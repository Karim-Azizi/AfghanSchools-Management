    "ID_S1_004|10/25/2025 4:19:02|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|2016–2021|After 2001, it was essential for any Afghan leader to enjoy comprehensive rule and strategic legitimacy. First, comprehensive rule was necessary to pursue the unification of Afghanistan's religions, ethnicities, and tribes into a single state and national identity. Years of violent conflict had torn apart the fabric of Afghan society, and almost everywhere in Afghanistan, the risk of destruction from political unrest was higher than usual. Only through leadership that embraces power sharing and representation can Afghanistan hope to achieve a certain level of political stability and social cohesion. Second, as much as reestablishing state authority will be part of the maturation of the Afghan state, strategic legitimacy locally, regionally, and globally will be fundamental to this transformation. Domestic legitimacy has been based on two main objectives: responding to citizens' needs and providing a minimum level of services, and respecting Islamic and traditional values, which are also important elements of domestic legitimacy. Restoring international legitimacy and gaining a certain level of diplomatic credibility requires some ability to counter foreign influence and address negative perceptions of living under the tutelage of external actors and their sovereign powers. Without a legitimate foundation, any government risks being seen as an external power transfer, and the absence of legitimacy undermines any progress toward long-term stability.|Afghan leaders have made progress, but they also have to deal with ongoing challenges in bringing together formal government institutions and traditional institutions like the Loya Jirga and local councils. Programs such as the Loya Jirga and the National Solidarity Program have involved local leaders in some decision-making and development initiatives, although they have not always been effective. In many locations, local loyalties, instability, and lack of government capacity have made it difficult to fully integrate these systems.|Heavy reliance on foreign funding and technical assistance hampered the development of self-reliant and accountable strategic thinking among Afghan leaders, as donors predetermined or influenced a large portion of the budget and major projects. As a result, leaders generally felt compelled to prioritize donor commitments over national priorities. This, in turn, fostered a dependency mindset that stifled initiative and weakened local accountability, as success came to be defined more by satisfying foreign partners than by addressing the realities faced by Afghan citizens.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Neutral|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Neutral|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|Aside from the financial situation, the significant weakness affecting service delivery and policy implementation was the limited capability and expertise in government institutions. Many ministries and local offices did not have qualified staff, systems, or coordination, which ultimately created significant obstacles to mobilize plans into action. This affected timeliness, productivity, and public frustrations across all sectors, including health, education, and infrastructure. |Inability to provide security|An example is Afghanistan's National Solidarity Program (NSP), which empowered people at the community level through Community Development Councils.

Conversely, programs that did not respect cultural contexts were likely to be rejected by communities, underscoring the critical importance of cultural appropriateness in programming.|The key takeaway from 2001-2021 is that effective and acceptable governance is not created just from external funding or external institutions; it has to be central to local political reality and social trust. In Afghanistan, efforts were primarily centered on creating a formal structure and the institution needed to satisfy donor expectations, yet when institutions lacked legitimacy to traditional leadership, customary practices, and citizen need, they were often presented an illusion of legitimacy. Sustainable governance requires a balance between contemporary state institutions and local authority, security, the provision of basic services, and accountability grounded in the people themselves.|Not provided\n",

People continued to view local solutions as more credible and fair than resorting to official channels.|The most important lesson of this course is that effective and legitimate governance is sustainable when its political and social ownership arises from within the society, not imposed from without. In a country like Afghanistan, legitimacy does not come from the ballot box or international support alone; it requires internal consensus, coherence with the cultural and social context, transparency, and genuine participation of the people in decision-making. Governance is strengthened when formal state structures, local community values, and traditional institutions are connected; stability and legitimacy are undermined when this connection is ignored.|Yes! An important point that has been less addressed is the importance of institutional continuity in the process of state-building in Afghanistan. Experience has shown that extensive, accelerated, and person-centered changes in leadership, diplomacy, and government structures have caused no policy or program to survive. In the absence of continuity, capacities were not accumulated, historical memory was not formed, and each government effectively started from scratch. In my opinion, if policies and institutions had structural stability, a culture of accountability, and a program-centered approach, many domestic and international efforts in the path of state-building in Afghanistan would have had more lasting and effective results.\n",

    "ID_S1_012|10/26/2025 17:36:30|Former Afghan Government Official|2011–2015, 2016–2021|In my opinion, given Afghanistan's unique characteristics, not only over the past 20 years but also in the future, an effective leader can only be effective if, as a first step, they have a cross-ethnic vision for the country and consider Afghanistan to be connected to and dependent on all of its ethnic groups. Second, they must be specialized. To overcome and properly manage the crisis, they must assemble a team of experts to organize matters with complete competence, experience, and understanding. In short, a cross-ethnic vision and a specialized, experience-centered vision are essential characteristics of an effective leader in Afghanistan.|Afghan leaders managed to build relationships between official institutions and traditional structures to some extent, but this balance was unstable. For example, during the reigns of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, the Loya Jirga councils were used for national decision-making, but no sustainable coordination with government institutions was established.|Unfortunately, Afghanistan was completely dependent on aid from the international community, and this total dependence meant that, in times of crisis and decision-making, the country's leaders were unable to make independent decisions based on the national interests of the country. As a result, the outcome and repercussions of this situation were exactly what the United States wanted.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Widespread corruption|I disagree with the lack of financial resources.

It is a very detailed story that cannot be described here.|I think the biggest lesson that can be learned is that if a country like Afghanistan wants to emerge from the crisis, they must be careful in choosing and appointing their leaders, they must vote for people who will work for Afghanistan, and in the second step, the priority of the leaders and all the people should be the collective interests of the country. We voted based on ethnic affiliations, the leaders decided based on their ethnic affiliations, and the result was that the country became more critical. The big lesson is to appoint people based on their competence, honesty, and expertise, not ethnic affiliations, language, etc. In short, post-conflict countries need competent and honest people who prioritize the interests of the country above everything else.|While recalling the issues mentioned above, the most important issue that is vital for Afghanistan is governance away from emotions; over the past few decades, we have tried to turn the country into a battlefield and a conflict between neighbors with emotional policies. Afghanistan will not develop unless a neighbor called Pakistan feels at ease with us. Strategic wisdom dictates that we observe moderation in our relations between India and Pakistan to protect ourselves from possible harm from Pakistan, which we have unfortunately not done so far.\n",
    "ID_S1_013|10/26/2025 17:42:03|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|2011–2015|In my opinion, the two most important qualities for an effective Afghan leader after 2001 were: 1. The ability to build national unity: After years of war and ethnic conflict, an effective leader must be able to build trust and solidarity among different groups, ethnicities, and religions in order to lay the foundations for a sustainable nation-state. 2. Commitment to transparency and fighting corruption: During the reconstruction period in Afghanistan, rampant corruption was one of the main challenges. A leader who emphasizes transparency, accountability, and justice is able to maintain the trust of the people and the international community and make the development process sustainable.|Unfortunately, customs and traditions still prevail in many parts of the country, and tribal values are paramount. On the other hand, during the 20-year republic, some outsiders did not believe in these customs and traditions, and some even showed an excessive desire to use them to polish their image in front of the public by respecting customs and traditions. In my opinion, the result of these trends was a more critical situation in the country. We have multifaceted crises and problems in the country that must be solved with modern science, a specialized perspective, and effective diplomacy, or at least a reasonable solution must be found for them. However, not only did we lack a logical and specialized perspective in this area, but we also wanted to solve the country's most sensitive problems through the Loya Jirga, a council whose members are mostly illiterate or have limited education. In fact, the country's constitution stipulates that the constitution can be amended through the Loya Jirga, although it has its own procedures. In my opinion, after 2001, Afghan leaders were only able to build effective bridges between official state institutions and traditional structures, such as local councils and jirgas, to a limited extent. On the one hand, attempts were made to use traditional structures in decision-making. For example, the 2003 Constitutional Loya Jirga, the Consultative Peace Jirga, and the Jirga for the Release of Taliban Prisoners in subsequent years were examples of using local traditions to legitimize national decisions. These councils helped people feel that they had a stake in the political process. On the other hand, in many cases, a gap remained between the central government and local structures. The government failed to integrate these traditional institutions into the formal system in a sustainable manner. As a result, government decisions were sometimes met with opposition or mistrust at the local level. In short, attempts were made to build links, but these links were not sustainable or institutionalized, and one of the main weaknesses in the Afghan state-building process remained.|Overreliance on international financial and technical assistance has had profound effects on the development of independent strategic thinking among Afghan leaders. On the one hand, this reliance has led to the country's overall planning and decision-making being influenced by the priorities, policies, and interests of donor countries, rather than the real needs of Afghan society. As a result, many leaders focused on attracting foreign support to seize power and manage aid resources, rather than on developing sustainable national strategies. On the other hand, this situation has weakened the culture of domestic accountability; when budgets and resources are mainly provided from abroad, leaders feel less pressure to be accountable to the people. In other words, they derived their legitimacy more from international support than from public satisfaction. As a result, excessive reliance on foreign aid has hindered the growth of intellectual independence, institutional self-sufficiency, and political accountability among the Afghan leadership.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not very effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, rampant corruption, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|In addition to a lack of financial resources, one of the most notable internal weaknesses of Afghan state institutions was their lack of effective administrative and organizational capacities, coupled with rampant corruption.

Second, he must be honest and accountable to his people—a leader who stands with his people, leads them through their pain, grief, and hopes, and leads them with honesty.|He believes that Afghan leaders have many ways to build an effective relationship between formal government institutions and traditional communities and structures. Most of the time, both systems were in a state of distrust. The executive branch of the high command spent a lot of time on energy, which was important to him. On the other hand, traditional and tribal councils are crowded with government officials, have elders who do not trust them, and are rife with political corruption. In addition, traditional and local councils are more isolated from the armed forces and the opposition. Some political leaders have tried, but unfortunately, their symbolic efforts have been short-lived. In the case of the Loya Jirga, a local jirga was formed, the debate was managed, and everything was symbolic of his policies. Overall, this relationship remained incomplete—neither traditional structures, nor formal government institutions, nor the trust of the people were strengthened.|I believe that the country has relied too heavily on foreign political leaders and financial and technical assistance, which has weakened Afghan leaders' sense of national responsibility and independent strategic thinking. When equipment is the last important part of the organization, we can clearly see how weak mid-level government managers are, as well as their independence, strategic thinking, and responsibility. The sense of ownership of the country and the government has been seriously damaged, and the country has become heavily dependent on foreigners and their financial and technical assistance. After 2016, many leaders tried to reduce dependence on the homeland and restore responsibility. Remember some examples. For example, in 2016, Americans seriously discussed strengthening the country's air force. Similarly, we have only 157 Black Hawk helicopters. The air force has received dozens of transport and large military equipment, giant fighter jets, fighter jets, and bombers. Every six months, dozens of young people in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Europe, and the United States receive training in the Air Force. For example, when the former president seriously discussed the Case Management System (CMS), he took the matter to the US Supreme Court. In front of millions of American citizens, biometric data and its transfer were discussed, the nationality of topographic information was discussed, security responsibilities were transferred, and he also had a lot of work under his control, but he did his best, did not feel ownership, relied on foreign countries, and ultimately paved the way for the fall.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|I believe that the most serious impact is weak internal institutions, corruption, political interference, and weak capacity (capacity gap).

The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) launched the Afghan National Integration Program around 2003 with the help of the World Bank. This program aims to empower villagers to make decisions and develop and implement projects. De Biera's factors: 1. Social values of harmony: The Afghan Rural Council Program, the Jirga Council, and the Partnership should be established. The villagers chose the Shura Council (Village Development Council) and decided to implement the project (road, water, school, bridge, electricity, etc.). 2. Trust and sense of ownership among the people: When the people participated in decision-making, they felt that they were managing the project themselves, not the government or foreigners. Corruption became more difficult. 3. Gradual participation of women: In areas where traditional restrictions exist, the structure of women's councils should be introduced gradually and cautiously. Da Franji prevented conflict and paved the way for Kibledo. The result: more than 35,000 projects benefited from the National Solidarity Program, and thousands of small development projects improved people's lives. The Community Development Program of the World Bank and other institutions is a successful example.

This leader must have strategic leadership and the ability to make decisive decisions in order to pursue a clear strategy for the country's stability, security, and long-term economic growth. A close relationship with the people and a deep understanding of the nation's needs and values are also essential for a leader, as the trust of the people is the foundation of any legitimate system. In addition, the leader of international relations must have the ability to manage effectively, so that the national interests of Afghanistan and its international partners are protected in a balanced manner.|After 2001, the Afghan government leadership faced political and administrative complexities in achieving an effective balance between formal institutions and traditional community structures, namely jirgas and local councils. The political and social reality in Afghanistan shows that traditional structures of legitimacy, arbitration, and social order are based on historical provisions, while formal government institutions represent modern governance, accountability, and the rule of law. Although some leaders have attempted to integrate the two by establishing consultative councils, these efforts have often failed to achieve effective coordination and long-term action. For example, the adoption of the Loya Jirga constitution and the participation of the people is a symbolic example, and the decision itself has not been fully implemented at the political or administrative level of the Loya government. Overall, the efforts of Afghan leaders and formal and informal institutions to build an effective bridge have been limited because they do not appreciate traditions and structures. This should be recognized as an authentic form, not only in modern state-building, but also in line with the principles of a sustainable framework.|His analysis, leadership of Afghanistan, international financial and technical assistance, and heavy reliance on independent strategic thinking and responsiveness had a profound impact on the institution. This dependence has often forced leaders to follow the requirements and conditions of international donors, limiting their ability to make independent, long-term policy decisions. It will also weaken the culture of accountability, because decisions about responsibility and accountability will, in most cases, depend on foreign institutions and their expectations. In addition, reliance on foreign aid has also limited local innovation, capacity building, and national resources based on decision-making capacity, damaging the government's legitimacy and public confidence.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|In addition to limited financial resources, limited human and administrative capacity in Afghan government institutions is one of the biggest internal obstacles that has had a profound impact on service delivery and policy implementation. Many institutions lack sufficient professional staff, administrative skills, and technical skills, limiting their ability to effectively meet the needs of the people. In addition, deficiencies in internal organizational structures, centralized decision-making, high centralization, lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms, and weak inter-agency coordination have prevented the effective implementation of policies. Overall, this internal weakness has not only led to a decline in service quality, but has also created a series of challenges in promoting government legitimacy and public trust, requiring a comprehensive strategic plan for future policymaking and government reforms.|Inability to provide security and rampant corruption|Afghanistan's Women's Rights Development Program, which is an important effort in governance and social reforms after 2001, can be presented as an important example that people have experienced both success and failure with social and cultural values.

This diplomatic example shows that the success of reforms and policies is directly related to the consideration of national and local values, traditions, and social sensitivities.|2001 = 2021 Afghanistan is based on experience, a post-conflict country, the most important thing for effective and legitimate governance is to build government reform and success in internal government capacities, stable security, coordination with national priorities, and respect for society's values |An important issue that has not been paid much attention to in Afghanistan's leadership, diplomacy and state building is the importance of internal trust, social capital, and long-term strategic leadership.

In addition, local leaders, communities, and cultural sensitivities take into account the lack of diplomatic efforts and international cooperation and influence.

    "ID_S2_004|Former Afghan Government Official|During the years 2011-2021, President Ashraf Ghani made a clear decision to support the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Gas Pipeline Project (TAPI Pipeline Project). At that time, Afghanistan was facing serious economic problems, such as energy shortages and restrictions on regional trade. Ashraf Ghani emphasized the priority of national interests and considered the overall interests of the country to be superior to ethnic or regional interests. He actively participated in international negotiations, signed relevant agreements, and approved the necessary internal measures for pipeline construction, such as land use and route selection. Although the project is not yet complete, Ghani's decision has paved the way for the expansion of regional economic cooperation and the creation of job opportunities for the people of Afghanistan, and has given the country international economic credibility. This is an example where national interests took precedence over ethnic interests and had positive outcomes.|Direct experience from a road construction project in Parwan province in 2017 showed how administrative and financial corruption hinders coordination. During the implementation of the contracts for this project, some contracting companies did not properly adhere to road construction standards, and in some sections, only a thin layer of sand was used. According to reports from local people and the press, the project delays and poor road quality were linked to corruption, as contracts were often awarded in the names of influential individuals. As a result, not only was the road quality poor, but coordination between government agencies and international partners was also slow, and service delivery to local people was affected. This example illustrates how corruption can have a serious negative impact on project implementation, service quality, and the coordination system.|A long-standing water distribution problem in Laghman province of Afghanistan has worsened due to poor cooperation between official institutions and local leaders. The provincial Department of Agriculture tried to start the construction project of a canal, but a place for consultation with the local jirgas and councils was not selected.

The government agencies relied solely on administrative orders, without providing opportunities for trust and participation to local leaders. The outcome was that the project was delayed, water distribution conflicts increased, and public dissatisfaction grew. This example illustrates that coordination between formal and traditional structures plays a vital role in resolving local conflicts.|The police building program in Afghanistan is an example where foreign aid had a negative impact against national interests. A lot of money was spent by international donors to fund and equip the police, but not enough attention was given to managing and building the capacity of the Afghan government's security sector. This process weakened the Afghan government's sovereignty and was driven solely by foreign priorities, not based on Afghanistan's long-term security needs. As a result, there was an increase in police corruption and a weakening of the government system, which had consequences against national interests.|A practical recommendation for Afghanistan's reconstruction is that the international community should implement each aid project thru Afghanistan's national budget and national institutions, rather than having different projects managed by separate donors. This not only prevents the waste of resources but also helps strengthen the country's governmental capacities. A joint fund should be established for aid, with financial oversight and management thru the Ministry of Finance, and project monitoring given to representatives of the community and government. Project implementation should be based on the consultation and participation of local people to ensure their needs are met correctly and to increase project effectiveness. To this end, the transparency of all projects and the monitoring of results should be done thru financial and non-financial audits.

    "ID_S2_009|International Diplomat/Representative of an International Organization|Regarding the transnational leader: In 2020, I was working at the Ministry of Water and Energy as the Director of Water Affairs Regulation for the General Directorate of the Kabul River Basin. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, initiated a move to divide the Ministry of Water and Energy into two agencies: the National Water Affairs Regulatory Authority and the National Energy Affairs Regulatory Authority. From an administrative perspective, this was a positive and national act because Afghanistan produces approximately 75 billion cubic meters of water annually but is unable to utilize 20% of this total due to mismanagement. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a single agency for comprehensive management of water resources to control Afghanistan's water resources thru a strategic plan spanning approximately 5 years and 10 years. Part A: This was a positive step toward economic growth for the country, improving agriculture from the water infrastructure. Part B: This action by the president failed because the president had ethnic and personal motives for two reasons. First, he turned the ministry into an administration because he wanted to be allowed by the constitution to appoint anyone to head an administration without needing a vote from parliament to elect them. Secondly, according to the agreements of the unity government, the Ministry of Water and Energy belonged to Dr. Abdullah. How could he have his close associates in this ministry when he had turned the ministry into a management?|Corruption as an obstacle to coordination, there were two reasons for the president to carry out widespread corruption. First, he appointed someone close to him to head the administration, and thru this, he was able to implement the infrastructure projects for the imaginary water facilities and add their cost to his capital, which he almost did. Or, he contracted and implemented the infrastructure projects for the water facilities with several companies that were from his own people, and he did. I witnessed several projects; a small example of this was the maintenance and care of the Darunta Dam, which cost approximately 53 million Afghanis. This project was contracted by a company from his own people, and it can be said that this project was contracted for 25 million. Secondly, according to the law, the head of the administration was appointed by the president, and this head of the administration was accountable and reported to no one other than the president. Even Parliament, the embodiment of the people's will, did not have the authority to remove or hold them accountable.|Regarding the gap between the formal and dominant institutions, I must say that since the ministries and departments were restructured, the president, according to the constitution, had the authority to choose the head of the department himself. Parliament, which represented the people, had no vote or authority in this process. For this reason, a person close to power or with political influence was usually appointed to head the departments, rather than technical and expert individuals. The person who was appointed only reported to the president and was not accountable to any other institution. For example, in the Surkh Rod district of Nangarhar province (the Sultanpur area), a project to build a protective wall was implemented. I don't remember the exact cost, but it was very high. This project was approved thru the Ministry of Energy and Water at the time. The wall was supposed to be two and a half meters high below ground, hidden from public view, but it was only built to a height of about one and a half meters; another meter remained incomplete, and unsuitable materials were used. When the flood came, the wall collapsed and caused extensive damage to people's land. People complained, but because the head of the department and his close associates were involved at the top of the project, no one dared to follow up. The implementing company was also owned by the head of the department himself and was mostly selected based on ethnic ties. At that time, such disputes were unsolvable because when the project is the government itself and the government's power is behind it, the people have no way to resist. As a result, the problem remained unresolved and no authority had the jurisdiction to investigate.|At the National Water Resources Management Authority where I worked, foreign aid played a very effective role. No independent decisions were made; most projects were funded thru the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and the implementation of the projects depended on these resources. When the Ministry of Energy and Water was transformed into the National Water Regulatory Authority, a new problem arose: the authority was no longer accountable to parliament because its head was appointed by the president and only reported to him. There was no regulatory authority (except for the president himself). For this reason, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank stopped their aid. They said, \"We will not give money to an office that is not accountable and cannot be questioned.\" While the minister was approved by parliament and accountable to the people when the ministry existed. However, the administration lacked such legitimacy, which is why many of the projects that were in the plan were not implemented and remained unfinished.|Based on my experience with the reconstruction situation in Afghanistan, if the international community wants to intervene in post-war countries, it should provide aid thru non-governmental and international organizations (NGOs), not directly thru the government. Because when aid is channeled thru the government, there is usually nepotism, ethnic discrimination, and widespread corruption. The minister gives orders to his close associates, they pass them on to their employes, and the result is that the budget doesn't reach the real people. But in the international model: • A donor entity provides the funds, and a specific institution implements the project. • The second body independently (directly or indirectly) monitors whether the aid has reached the intended recipients. • Separate oversight reduces corruption and increases transparency. For this reason, if aid is provided thru international organizations and strong monitoring teams are in place, no one can act against global standards and people will benefit more from the results.\n",

However, in Nangarhar province, administrative corruption at the level of the Public Health Directorate and local contractors led to contracts being awarded to affiliated companies and the work being carried out poorly. Many clinics remained unfinished, and the WHO temporarily suspended funding for the project. Administrative corruption hindered people's access to healthcare services and reduced the confidence of donors.|In 2018, the government initiated the Jaghori Dam project in Ghazni province without consulting the people of Andar district. People protested because they said the watercourse passed thru their land and their rights were being ignored. Because government officials did not cooperate with local elders and guilds, tensions escalated and the project was halted for several months. The lack of cooperation between the government and traditional structures caused delays in the project and led to public distrust.|From 2017 to 2020, several development projects in road construction and water supply were implemented in Daikundi province by USAID and UNOPS. Foreign donors themselves determined the routes, companies, and even the type of building materials, without sufficient coordination with the local administration or the people. Local officials suggested the road route pass thru more populated areas so more people could benefit, but because the final decision was made at the Kabul headquarters with the input of foreign consultants, the less beneficial route was chosen. The project was implemented at a high cost but with less benefit.|Afghanistan's experience shows that when decisions are made without consulting the people, transparency, and a national perspective, the outcome is usually failure; whether in ethnic decisions, government and administrative discussions, or projects implemented under foreign influence. Therefore, in any future international intervention, the aid framework should revolve around a few principles: first, national ownership – decisions should be made domestically, with the leadership of the government and local people, not in foreign offices, and not with the ethnic bias of past governments. Second, accountability and transparency – all projects must be implemented thru the national budget to enable monitoring and accountability. Third, public consultation – local councils and community elders should be involved in project design and monitoring from the outset to prevent ethnic and social conflicts. And in the financial resources section, there needs to be very close monitoring and auditing to prevent financial corruption.\n",
    "ID_S2_011|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|About transnational leadership during the National Unity Government or the Republic from 2014-2020 is that the appointment of governors and heads of departments in Ghor was often based on ethnic affiliation and political pressure, not on merit. In several cases, individuals close to specific ethnic factions were appointed to head local departments such as Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Education, and Health. The result was increased ethnic competition between Tajiks, Hazaras, and Pashtuns within the administration, reduced coordination between institutions, many development projects remained unfinished, people lost trust in the administration, and social divisions widened.|Corruption as an obstacle to the coordination of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development's development projects, especially water supply and road construction projects in the province's districts. Contract companies were selected thru the mediation of some local officials, and a large portion of the project budget was embezzled. Some projects were never completed at all, or their quality was very low. As a result, donors like USAID and UNDP halted a portion of the funding, and project implementation was delayed for several years. Local people lost trust in government institutions.|The gap between the formal and traditional institutions of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, which implemented an irrigation project without consulting local jirgas. Because the stream's path passed thru land belonging to another village and their consent had not been obtained, the conflict between the two villages escalated and the project was halted. Several months later, negotiations were resumed with the mediation of tribal elders, but government institutions had already lost their credibility.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic governance in adapting aid projects, particularly in the health and education sectors, which were funded by foreign entities such as USAID and the World Bank. Decision-making regarding priorities and budget was primarily done in Kabul and by foreign entities, without considering the actual needs of the people. Health centers were built in a few districts of the province, but permanent human resources and budget were not provided for them. The projects were seemingly completed but closed down after a few months. This dependence on external decisions made the local government feel powerless to manage independently.|Practical recommendations for the future based on my personal experiences. Aid should be managed and monitored thru local councils, namely Jirgas and Development Councils, not just from Kabul or foreign institutions. Local people should have a direct role in all stages, from planning to consumption. The reason is that in projects where the people of Ghor were involved in decision-making, such as some national solidarity and citizenship programs, there was less corruption and the work was actually completed. However, in projects where decisions were made in Kabul or by foreigners, more funds were wasted and there was no accountability.\n",

From 2011 to 2021, the decisions made did not consider national interests. For example, the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners was based not on national interests, but on the personal and ethnic interests of the president. They were all dangerous criminals and murderers. And the Afghan peace process continues to be based on national interests, and the process has been and remains unsuccessful.|There are many examples of corruption, especially in the health and rural development parts of projects designed by international organizations. These projects were halted due to ethnic and regional biases. The CASA-1000 power line, which was supposed to pass from Bamyan to Kabul, was unfortunately stopped. The Bamyan Provincial Hospital, which was supposed to be upgraded to a regional hospital, was also halted, even tho the Ministry of Public Health had approved the plan and the president had stopped the budget.|No response|Foreign aid had a direct impact on government departments, especially the security sectors. All appointments had to be made thru the donor channel. Appointments of high-ranking government officials were determined and implemented based on the vote of the financial donors, ministries, and sectors. Afghanistan's foreign policy was under the control of foreign donors. All of Afghanistan's diplomatic relations were designed and designed according to Western interests, and it did not have the independent ability to make decisions, which had a direct impact on the people and national interests of Afghanistan. National interests were influenced by the interests of foreigners (the United States and the European Union).| Prioritizing the strengthening of local institutions and transparency in the budget. A local institution must be involved beforehand. One of the failures in the reconstruction of Afghanistan was the focus on institutions and organizations in Kabul, while neglecting local needs. Many projects were designed without consulting local people, which did not address their needs, and there was also a lack of transparency in project implementation. The creation of local councils led to people feeling a sense of ownership, and the decision was correct, with satisfactory results. The plan to establish local councils and monitor their oversight of project implementation helps build trust and ensures effective reconstruction.\n",

    "ID_S2_014|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|During this period, ethnic interests and the concentration of power were prioritized over national interests, which led to negative outcomes and structural inefficiency. For example, the head of the Presidential Affairs Department was Fazl al-Mahmud Fazli. Mr. Fazli had studied nursing and did not have the understanding and knowledge of a large and important structure like the Presidential Affairs Department. Their selection was based on ethnicity and proximity to Ghani.|Aid and funding organizations for Afghan projects have always complained about corruption within the structures and were well aware of its widespread presence. The majority of Afghanistan's development projects were supported by the international community and implemented by state-owned companies, which were not executed properly due to wasted project budgets, leading to low project quality. For example, the Kabul-Kandahar road was built with low-quality materials and was very inefficient, deteriorating sooner than the standard they had set.|Ghani had a dual perspective. In its own ethnic structure, there was no problem with local councils. The Jirga somehow saw itself as the guarantor of power's firmness, but the ethnic, local organizations and ethnic Jirgas of other ethnic groups were seen as a threat to its power, and it said, \"We can no longer tolerate the 'island of power'.\" The reason for Ghani's conflict with other ethnic groups caused people not to support Ghani's government and further widened the gap between the government and the nation. For example: The construction of the Ghazni-Jaghori road was halted for several years and was eventually left unfinished.|In short, \"He who provides the bread, commands.\" Afghanistan couldn't even cover its regular annual budget, let alone development and emergency budgets... This meant that he couldn't even make his own decisions independently regarding ministerial appointments, let alone foreign policy.

The bomber only flew over Jawzjan, and he called himself and agreed to everything.|The international community makes decisions based on its own interests; no other issue matters to them except their own interests. And the international community is the representative of the implementation of American policy in countries and does not have an independent will of its own. It seems that if the international community participates with a mechanism whose key is in the hands of the United States, it is not suitable at all. If the mechanism benefits both the international community and Afghanistan, that's good. International structures have lost their credibility and are largely serving the interests of the great powers.

Please provide a specific example of a decision made by a senior government official (2011-2021) that: A) prioritized national interests over ethnic interests and had a positive outcome. B) was influenced by ethnic bias and resulted in failure. For example: One of the senators from Daikundi province brought an antenna mast to Daikundi province for the first time, but installed it behind his own house. When people from other areas went to see him, the antenna base was supposed to be in the center of the district, but he refused and had stolen the guests' shoes to humiliate the elders of the people. Please briefly explain the context of the decision, the action taken, and the outcome. That senator was extremely regionalist and eventually had the antenna base installed behind his house, and the people's complaints went unheard.|Corruption as an obstacle to coordination: Analysis of previous questionnaire data showed that widespread corruption is the main obstacle to cooperation between the government and international partners. Please describe a direct experience or observation from an international project or program (such as health, education, or rural development) where administrative or financial corruption caused:  Delays or the stoppage of the project, for example, in Bamyan, the Islamic Relief organization was active in Bamyan. Once, approximately 40 million Afghanis intended for distribution to vulnerable people were embezzled by the respected head of the organization in collaboration with several of the organization's employes, who then fled.

    "ID_S2_016|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|During the rule of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan under Presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, senior officials served who prioritized national interests over ethnic, partisan, and religious interests. A prime example of this could be the extension of the security agreement between the Afghan government and NATO, which resulted in national security and national interests being guarantyd for a specific period. In contrast, a limited number of party leaders working within the government structure prioritized ethnic interests over national interests, and their ethnic policies widened divisions among the people, ultimately undermining national unity. Political parties active in Afghanistan were operating with an expanding ethnic agenda to attract supporters and win elections. Parties should not have considered ethnic, regional, linguistic, religious, or other factors that harm national interests and unity as criteria for their activities. As a result, division among the people increased and hopes for a bright future diminished. Afghanistan's credibility with the international community diminished and international aid was limited. Because most of these aids were misused by these individuals, and the path to Afghanistan's growth and development was challenged.|One sector that did not yield positive results due to widespread administrative corruption was Afghanistan's education sector. Due to the existence of ghost schools and teachers, most of the government's money and budget was embezzled by ministers and senior officials. Cases of administrative corruption in Afghan courts speak to the widespread corruption and lack of transparency. International aid, without effective accountability from ministry leaders, led to delays in the delivery of international assistance and a decline in the quality of education in the country.|International aid provided to Afghanistan should have been implemented in full coordination with the local people thru beneficial projects. Most areas of Afghanistan lack access to safe water, and projects implemented by international NGOs like DACAAR to improve access to safe water often faced implementation difficulties due to local conflicts. Every village or location wanted to implement these projects in their areas, but due to budget constraints, it was difficult for the aid received to reach all vulnerable areas. In many cases, local people prevented the implementation of foreign projects due to security concerns and the activities of armed opponents in their areas. In some cases, these issues were resolved in coordination with local CDC councils, and the local people provided specific conditions to allow these projects to be adapted. For example, the water supply project in Badakhshan and Kunar provinces, which were insecure and had limited access to the government, was implemented with the advice and coordination of local councils because these were humanitarian aid and did not pursue political goals, so the local people allowed the implementation. In conflict-ridden areas, there are widespread disputes over water sources, including the legal ownership of these water resources, which is contested by local people. This has caused project implementation to be delayed or halted.|On the one hand, foreign aid played a very important and vital role for the Afghan government and people in the post-civil war period. However, most of this aid was implemented without oversight and at the discretion of the donor countries, and the Afghan people were unaware of the amount of this aid and how it was spent. Civil activists have mostly expressed their concern that the lack of transparency in the use of domestic budgets and international aid undermines the effectiveness of these contributions. In some cases, donor countries often prioritized their national interests over foreign aid. For example, the aid provided by the Iranian government to the office of Hamid Karzai's government was due to American political and military competition, and they demanded their interests in return for this aid from the Afghan government. The aid that the Indian government continued to provide for the development of Afghanistan was aimed at weakening Pakistan's regional role in the Afghan issue. These factors, which exacerbated regional conflict and competition with neighboring countries, ultimately had a significant impact on national interests and security.|The main recommendation for improving international aid delivery by the global community is to provide transparent mechanisms for implementing these projects so that accountability for these projects is clear to the people. This aid should be under the direct supervision of the people, and the basic priorities of the people should be considered in the preparation of development plans. Afghanistan is in dire need of international aid. Afghanistan is not a poor country and is not in dire need of international aid. The government cannot handle this humanitarian crisis alone, and the international community must continue its assistance. Foreign aid provided by international aid organizations did not reduce poverty in the country due to a lack of transparency, and public distrust of this aid increased. Afghanistan is still an economically weak country, and according to international statistics, Afghanistan faces a harsh winter, making a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan still possible. In order for foreign institutional aid to be effectively implemented in the country, an effective accountability mechanism must be established in coordination with the government, civil society, and people's representatives so that this aid can be effectively implemented and Afghanistan can potentially achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n",

If we assume this statement is correct and disregard the existence of a concept called \"leader\" in Afghanistan, and consider an action that transcends one's nationality, we can cite the recognition of education by private institutions in the country as an effective measure. This decision was made and implemented by President Karzai and, in my opinion, is considered one of the lasting and historic actions for the country.| Very clearly and openly, Afghanistan is considered one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This incorrect historical pattern has a history dating back to the country's contemporary era, but it reached its peak during the decade of democracy. It's very difficult to provide an example of corruption! You might think that if there was so much widespread corruption, why would it be difficult to find such an example? The answer is that in all government projects, corruption was considered part of the job and was so institutionalized that no work could be considered exempt from corruption. Therefore, I mention the Ministry of Public Health's health project as an example. In the implementation of this important project, corruption was rampant and multi-faceted, which both delayed the project's completion and led to the ineffective use of international community aid.|One of the fundamental problems in Afghanistan is the conflict between tradition and modernity. This conflict manifests itself in various forms, sometimes as the government versus traditional society, and at other times in other forms such as modern education and schools, and so on. A large portion of unfinished projects and actions have been due to this conflict. If you look at the annual budget codes, you'll notice that a large portion of the allocated budgets hasn't been used. When you investigate the reason, you'll find that the local people have prevented the project from being implemented, saying it doesn't align with our traditions and customs. Specifically, I can mention the non-implementation of school construction projects in Khost and Logar provinces.|The Geneva meetings and the setting of 21 indicators by donors directly subordinated Afghanistan's policymaking and budget to foreign priorities. Instead of genuine reform, the government manipulated figures and engaged in a superficial fight against corruption to maintain the flow of aid. This process eliminated independent decision-making, institutionalized financial dependence, and sacrificed national interests for the sake of continued foreign aid.|Aid should be spent 100% thru the national budget and under local community oversight, rather than directly injecting currency and creating dependency, and the focus should be on strengthening domestic capacities.

For example, in the education sector in every province of Afghanistan, and similarly in every school at the provincial level, there were dozens and hundreds of fictitious teachers (there were no teachers at all). The name of the teacher was all that existed. Money and national budgets were embezzled by individuals at the leadership and management levels of the education sector. As a result, it caused the children of the people not to be absorbed into the education sector, and if they were, it was very little. It was unable to reduce the illiteracy rate as much as it could have.|For example, in Bamyan province (the center of Bamyan), in an area called Khoshkak, nearly a thousand houses have been built. These lands do not have official municipal documents, only customary ones. The government declared them public, and people began construction in this area. The municipality and land administration did not allow people to build here, but people started construction by paying money or using their connections with members of parliament or high-ranking officials of official institutions. However, this institution was unable or unwilling to solve the people's problems at their root, and now, with nearly a thousand homes built, they still lack municipal deeds and maps, and the government considers this land its own. Now the government is in trouble. If it demolishes all these houses, it will cost the government a lot of money, and the people will also be in a state of uncertainty and confusion. This indicates gaps in formal and legal institutions.|In Afghanistan, the president was appointed by the United States of America in consultation with the European Union. Because the United States of America and its partner organizations like USAID, etc., were the biggest contributors in Afghanistan. It caused the people of Afghanistan to lose trust in the democratic and electoral process, as exemplified by the 2019 presidential election, which I myself voted in. However, the voter turnout was really low; the election site staff were just hoping someone would come and cast their vote.|If the international community wants to intervene in a post-conflict country, I have a few recommendations: 1) It must create strong, impartial infrastructure that is in line with the country's culture (such as transparent laws, the rule of law, impartial and accountable election monitoring bodies). 2) If other international organizations provide financial and humanitarian aid, instead of distributing it directly to the people, they should create employment opportunities, for example, by assisting and reviving sectors such as agriculture, handicrafts, and tourism, so that people can become self-sufficient and overcome their problems. 3) Establishing independent, impartial, and accountable media outlets for the people. 4) Establishing democratic institutions where the people themselves can choose their own destiny and their own leader. 5) Local people should have a role in how aid is distributed or consumed. 6) Instead of being consumptive, the focus on how aid is used should be developmental and infrastructural. 7) Instead of being distributed thru NGOs, aid should be created in the form of an agricultural bank or reconstruction. For example, it wants to provide low-interest loans to individuals in the agricultural sector or other businesses. If these individuals are successful, they will be given more loans or their interest will be waived so that people are encouraged to solve their own problems instead of always relying on aid.\n",
    "ID_S2_020|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|President Hamid Karzai's 2013 decision to jointly recruit young people from different ethnic groups to expand the national army is an example where national interests were prioritized over ethnic interests, resulting in a relatively positive outcome. Conversely, the decisions of some politicians during the 2019-2020 elections, which were based on ethnic biases, led to unsuccessful outcomes. a) National interests take precedence over ethnic interests - positive example • Background: From 2011 to 2014, the security situation in Afghanistan was poor and the withdrawal of international forces had been announced. It was necessary for the army and national police to be able to defend the entire country. • Action: Hamid Karzai announced a program to expand the national army, under which young people from different ethnic groups were recruited jointly. The recruitment process was intentionally designed to represent all of Afghanistan instead of a specific ethnic group. • Result: A relative balance was created in the camp's structure, which strengthened the sense of national identity and increased its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. Although problems remained, this decision reflected a transnational vision. b) Decision based on ethnic preferences – a failed example • Background: In the 2019-2020 elections, there was intense competition among political groups. Some high-ranking officials were making decisions to appease their ethnic supporters. • Action: Some politicians, whose support was based on ethnicity, opposed the election results and declared a parallel government. Instead of supporting transparent trends and national unity, decisions became subject to ethnic preferences. • Result: A legitimacy crisis was created, public trust in the government decreased, and the ground was prepared for the Taliban to regroup. This is a clear example of the negative consequences of a lack of national vision.|The Kabul Bank case – a clear example of corruption • Background: Kabul Bank was the largest private bank in Afghanistan and was used to pay salaries and finance development projects. International aid and government financial programs were primarily channeled thru this bank. • Action: Between 2010 and 2013, senior bank officials and individuals close to the government illegally withdrew approximately billion for personal gain. This corruption occurred thru fake loans, personal expenses, and funding political networks. • Result: Projects were halted: Educational and health projects whose salaries and budgets were paid thru Kabul Bank were delayed for several months. The quality of services decreased: Teachers and doctors were unable to continue working due to not receiving their salaries, and the quality of educational and health services declined. Cutting off foreign aid: International partners, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF), suspended aid programs to Afghanistan until the government takes serious action against corruption. By October 2012, only a small portion of the stolen money had been recovered, severely damaging global trust. Consonance obstacle (harmony) • This case showed that corruption is not just a domestic problem, but also erodes the trust of international partners. • The cessation and cutting of aid destroyed the atmosphere of cooperation between the government and the world and became a major obstacle to development projects. Result: The Kabul Bank scandal is a clear answer to this question: corruption causes project delays, reduces service quality, and cuts off foreign aid. This experience proves that the lack of transparency and accountability is the biggest obstacle to coordinating development programs.|The gap between formal and traditional institutions • Province: Helmand • Problem: Conflict over water resources (Helmand River water division) Explanation :In Helmand province, the water distribution problem worsened due to poor cooperation between government agencies and traditional local councils. • Background: The Helmand River's seawater is of vital importance for agriculture. There was no coordination between the government's official programs and the traditional decisions of the local elders. • Result: Water disputes increased, some areas faced water scarcity, and agricultural production decreased. The lack of joint decision-making between formal and traditional institutions hindered problem-solving. Positive control sample • Province: Nangarhar • Problem: Property dispute • Result: Due to effective cooperation between the state court and the local jirga, the land dispute was resolved jointly and both parties accepted the decision. Result: These examples show that when there is no cooperation (like in Helmand), conflicts are prolonged. But when cooperation is effective (like in Nangarhar), the problem is solved relatively successfully.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic autonomy . Example: The 2013-2015 security strategy, which was based on US and NATO assistance. Background • Due to the withdrawal of international forces (2014), the Afghan government was forced to design a large part of its security strategy and budget based on US and NATO aid. • The priority of global war contributors with the Taliban was to help and maintain major cities, not to create widespread local stability. Action • The focus of the national security strategy was placed on cities and highways, as requested by global partners. • Security funding was reduced for remote areas because donors controlled resource allocation according to their own priorities. Negative consequences • Contrary to national interests: The government's need was to secure the villages, but due to external pressure, security was only concentrated in the cities. • Result: The Taliban's influence in remote areas increased. The government's legitimacy decreased. Instead of long-term stability, a short-term defensive strategy was formed that was at odds with national interests. Result: This example shows that when national policy is subject to the priorities of foreign donors, the government's strategic independence is weakened, and the outcome is detrimental to national interests.|Practical advice for the future. Recommendation: Aid should be spent thru the \"national single budget,\" but under the transparent oversight of local people and with independent accountability mechanisms. How to make it practical • 1. National Unified Budget Framework: All global aid must be spent thru the official government budget, not thru separate donor projects. This prevents the creation of parallel offices and ensures coordination with national programs. • 2. Local Monitoring: At the provincial and district levels, people's councils or civil society organizations should monitor the implementation of projects. This reduces corruption and increases public trust. • 3. Independent Accounting: A common accounting system should be established for the use of aid, involving the government, global donors, and civil society. Reasons based on failures • During the reconstruction of Afghanistan, much of the aid was spent outside the government budget, resulting in: or creating parallel offices, or weakening the government's legitimacy, the increase in corruption, and the loss of public trust. Reasons based on successes • Projects implemented thru national budgets and under public supervision (such as some rural development projects) were relatively successful because people considered them \"their own projects.\" Result: To succeed in war-torn countries, aid must be channeled solely thru the national budget and be spent under public oversight and an independent accounting system. This framework prevents corruption, strengthens government legitimacy, and increases public trust.\n",

Dr. Ferozuddin Feroz acted transnationally, transethnically, and transsectorally in the field of public health, achieving very positive results in the Ministry of Public Health and the health sector. These positive actions led to him being recognized as the best Minister of Public Health in the world.|In the widespread corruption that was known as one of the factors in the previous government, we can give a specific example: the discussion about one of the development projects in Charikar city, Parwan province. Widespread corruption among parliamentary lawyers and local strongmen caused the project to be halted. The concrete and asphalt paving project was for the Charikar city intersection, which is known as the same intersection of resistance. Here, the local strongmen pressured the international body or institution that was the donor for this project, demanding that our share be paid. The same company and the same institution that was the project implementer stopped the project, and it finally reached the point where, after 2021, during the Taliban's rule, the project was completed.|Foreign aid weakens the strategic decisions of the government and the nation because relying on foreign aid stifles initiative and makes us solely dependent on international and foreign assistance and cooperation. That's why we can't choose our own initiative and a correct perspective. For example, US aid and equipment for the training and education of the national army, which was entirely dependent on them, did not benefit the people much, and ultimately, the forces they deployed, Units 01 and 02, were deployed by them based on strategic decisions and plans that the government had not prepared or trained for, and ultimately, the US government took them with them. He took them with him, calling them his created and trained forces, not because they were being used effectively in Afghanistan's security affairs.|Afghanistan should have a thorough situation analysis based on impartial monitoring and surveys. Based on the analysis results and the situation, aid should be pledged to Afghanistan and transferred to Afghanistan thru Afghanistan's own national budget, and the use of this budget in Afghanistan should be monitored to prevent corruption in its expenditure. In other words, the institution or donor that is cooperating, or the international community itself, should closely monitor how its cooperation is being used. This is how monetary and financial corruption is prevented and a positive change is brought about in the work process.|\n",
    "ID_S2_022|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|A clear example of both states can be found during the Republic era (2011-2021). For example, we can recall Ashraf Ghani's decision to sign a security agreement with the United States, which he stated aimed to prioritize national interests over ethnic interests. Karzai refused to sign the treaty, but Hanif Atmar, the then foreign minister, signed the treaty on behalf of Ashraf Ghani in 2014. After the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the debate over signing a \"Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA)\" with the United States was heated. Hamid Karzai refused to sign it, considering it contrary to national independence. However, at the beginning of the National Unity Government, despite political pressure from various ethnic factions, Ashraf Ghani decided to sign it. Ashraf Ghani stated that the purpose of this action was to ensure the survival of the government structure and security forces, maintain financial aid, and prevent a security vacuum. Many Pashtun-centric figures within the government and Karzai's circle opposed it by signing, but Ghani called it a \"national necessity.\" After signing this agreement, Western financial and military support for the Afghan government continued until 2021, and the Nano mission to assist and equip the national army continued. The signing of this treaty strengthened the international legitimacy of the Afghan government. Although this decision sparked criticism, it was a rare example of prioritizing national interests (in line with the survival of the republican system and the country's security) despite ethnic and political pressures, and it had positive short-term results. It is worth mentioning that Rahmatullah Nabil (former head of national security) also opposed political and ethnic pressures multiple times during his tenure as head of national security (2014-2016) and emphasized strengthening national and non-ethnic structures within the intelligence services. His opposition to the release of some Taliban figures, particularly due to political and ethnic pressures, was a sign of prioritizing national interests over ethnic interests. Nabil's resignation in protest against Ashraf Ghani's personal and discriminatory policies (during his visit to Pakistan) was a sign of his nationalist stance. b) Ethnically biased and exclusionary decisions (2017-2020). During Ashraf Ghani's second term as president, appointments in security institutions – particularly the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the National Directorate of Security – took on a distinctly ethnic flavor. Many commanders and governors were appointed based on the criterion of \"ethnic loyalty,\" regardless of their professional and technical competence. for example, in 2018, Ashraf Ghani appointed General Tariq Shah Bahrami (affiliated with a specific ethnic circle) as Minister of Defense instead of Abdullah Habibi. These changes, along with the gradual removal of Tajik and Uzbek commanders from security structures, sparked strong political reactions in the north of the country. This displacement weakened cohesion within the security forces and widened the gap between the northern forces and the central government. These decisions also undermined trust within the resistance fronts against the Taliban, ultimately leading to the rapid fall of provinces in 2021 as a result of the collapse of the chain of command and lack of coordination among the forces. This type of ethnocentric decision-making was an example of ethnic interests overriding national interests, which led to the weakening of the security structure and the collapse of the republican system. At the end of his second term, instead of strengthening national institutions, Hamid Karzai (President until 2014) strengthened a network of ethnic and local commanders to maintain his ethnic influence in the south of the country. In appointing governors and security officials, he prioritized ethnic balance over merit, and instead of strengthening \"nation-building,\" he pursued a policy of \"ethnic appeasement\" to ensure his political survival. These decisions of his had bad consequences and It rooted the culture of ethnic dealing in the government structure and passed it on to the next government. It then became clear that these Karzai programs were steps toward paving the way for the Taliban, until Ghani completed Karzai's unfinished mission by handing over the Arg to the Taliban. Amrullah Saleh (Ashraf Ghani's first deputy and former national security chief), despite his anti-terrorism and nationalist record, spoke from an ethnic perspective in the final years of his cooperation with Ghani, contributing to the polarization of the political atmosphere. Also, some of his statements and positions on social media, instead of emphasizing \"national convergence,\" sometimes took on an ethnic and linguistic tone. Such positions reduced the capacity for national unity within the anti-Taliban resistance front in the final days of the Republic.|No response|A clear example of this type of project can be explained in Nangarhar province, where the dispute was over water distribution in the Serekan (Spin Ghar) district. Between 2016 and 2019, the dispute between the farmers of two villages over the distribution of water from the \"Kameh\" irrigation canal intensified due to a lack of coordination between the Nangarhar Water Basin Department and local councils. Because the government had changed the canal route without consulting local influentials, local conflicts erupted and agricultural lands remained dry for several months. In contrast, a project in Bamyan province can be mentioned where the dispute over the boundary of agricultural lands in the village of \"Shiber\" (2018-2019) was resolved thru dialog. In this case, close cooperation between the Bamyan Department of Agriculture and local elders led to the establishment of a mediation committee, resolving the dispute peacefully thru dialog.|A specific example of this project was the decision-making process regarding the implementation of the \"TAPI\" project (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline) around the years 2015-2021, with the Asian Development Bank and the government of Turkmenistan as donors. Explanation: The Afghan government, under pressure and encouragement from foreign donors, especially the Asian Development Bank, prioritized the advancement of the TAPI project to be recognized as a regionally supported energy transit route. However, in practice, insecurity along the project route and the lack of guarantyd real benefits for the people of Afghanistan led to national investment in domestic energy infrastructure (such as electricity generation from northern gas or domestic dams) being overlooked. The failure of this project to materialize had negative consequences. This project never materialized, diverting government attention from more urgent domestic projects, increasing Afghanistan's political dependence on regional countries; as a result, Afghanistan's national interests were sacrificed to the geopolitical priorities of the donors.|Aid should be 100% channeled thru the government's national budget and monitored by the local people, not thru separate donor projects. Practical advice: In any post-war reconstruction program, before allocating funds and starting projects, a \"tripartite partnership structure\" must be established between the central government, local institutions, and civil society to ensure joint decision-making on priorities and monitoring of implementation. One successful example of this project was the Citizen Covenant program. In the \"Citizenship Covenant\" program (2016-2020), when village development councils participated in decision-making about small projects (such as roads or schools), the projects were implemented on time and with quality. However, in projects that were planned solely by ministries or foreign donors (such as some World Bank projects in the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development), work either stopped or the quality decreased due to local distrust and administrative corruption. This poor quality of projects will be resolved when they have genuine participation. This showed that without the genuine participation of the people and local leaders in design and monitoring, no foreign aid, even if it amounts to billions of dollars, will be sustainable or used effectively.\n",
    "ID_S2_023|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|Multinational countries and diverse societies need leaders who have a national and transnational vision to facilitate peaceful coexistence among all ethnic groups and various socio-political groups in light of the country/society's prevailing laws. My visit, along with that of former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, with the perspective of prioritizing ethnic interests, paved the way in 2021 for the downfall of a legitimate, inclusive government in favor of a specific ethnic group (the Taliban), both of whom are from the same ethnic background (Pashtun). He removed experienced and influential individuals from the ranks of the security forces and civil positions, gradually handed over districts to the Taliban one after another, and finally brought an end to the 20-year Republic with his own escape.|Many international partners were involved in the corruption of high-ranking Afghan officials, and in many cases, they prevented their prosecution by judicial and legal institutions. In my opinion, the hypothesis that widespread corruption was the main obstacle to cooperation between the government and international partners is incorrect. On the contrary, high-ranking government officials and most of their international partners were complicit in widespread corruption, including the law, police, judiciary, prosecution, parliament, and the military. Everything was under the control of this corrupt gang; there was no second authority to hold them accountable, and everyone was in cahoots. I have personally seen dozens of infrastructure projects that, despite consuming huge sums of money, have not lasted due to poor quality and are currently unusable.|One of the main reasons for the lack of institutionalization of laws in Afghanistan's various systems has been these traditional tribal structures, and in many cases, despite the clarity of the law, disputes were resolved by local elders, which often resulted in injustice in the decisions of local councils and tribal elders' assemblies. Traditional and tribal structures have never been supportive of the rule of law in the country; on the contrary, these structures have weakened the law.|Exactly, governments dependent on foreign aid are not independent in their decision-making. For example: The extraction of the Aynak copper mine in Logar province was awarded by the then government to a Chinese company, but due to the disagreements and conflicts between China and Western countries, led by the United States, and because the Chinese company was also the financial backer of the then government, the extraction of this national project was not allowed to be realized, and the government was obliged to follow the policies and guidelines of the United States.|Not all countries are in the same state after a war; some may need to rebuild buildings, roads, bridges, and highways. However, some of these countries may have a serious need and priority for education, promoting the rule of law, strengthening national unity, raising citizens' knowledge levels, avoiding violence, and so on. Okay. In any case, international aid should be distributed and used thru the government institutions of the war-torn country with international supervision.\n",

However, with the intervention of a politician who sought to profit from the project, the project was never implemented.|Province: Balkh :Type of problem: Water resource conflict (agricultural irrigation)In 2019, a dispute arose in Chamtal district of Balkh province between the two villages of Chashma Shirin and Aq Kupruk over the distribution of water from the Balkhab River. The Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Directorate, without consulting the village council and local elders, decided to change the water distribution route in the secondary canal to help the new irrigation project. Local leaders and the local council considered this decision unilateral and contrary to the previous agreement, and prevented its implementation. The government was also unable to implement the decision without local support. Result : The channel remained closed for about two months. Agricultural lands in both villages were dry and damaged. Physical and armed clashes occurred between young people from two villages, and several people were injured. The issue was only temporarily resolved after a joint council was formed between the government and local elders.|It is clear that non-discretionary budgets (foreign aid) have a negative impact on the independent decision-making of government institutions. A specific answer will be provided below. Decision Topic: Increasing the size of security forces beyond the country's financial capacity Time: 2011-2014. Effective Donor: United States and NATO. Area: Security Policy and National Budget. Following the Chicago and Tokyo conferences, international donors, particularly the United States, emphasized the rapid increase in the number of Afghan security forces (army and police) to approximately 352,000 personnel. This decision was based more on NATO's military objectives than on an assessment of Afghanistan's economic and administrative capacity. Why was it against national interests? The Afghan government had warned that the national budget could not afford to pay the salaries, logistics, and maintenance of this number of troops, but accepted the proposal due to its dependence on foreign aid. Negative consequences: Creating strong financial dependence; over 90% of security expenditures were paid for by foreign aid. After aid was reduced in the years 1398-1400, livelihoods and equipping units faced difficulties. Inability to maintain expensive equipment and aircraft that could only be operated by foreign specialists. Decreased morale and the collapse of the command structure in the final months of the regime.|The intervention of the international community should be contingent on non-interference in political and economic decision-making. Foreign aid should be provided with full transparency and comprehensive oversight. Prevent rent-seeking. The information vacuum is filled and independent institutions are formed for oversight.\n",
    "ID_S2_025|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|: A) In short and concise terms, a decision by a senior Afghan government official that prioritized national interests over ethnic interests, and which had positive results, led the government to decide in the years 2011-2021 to implement the important infrastructure project of constructing a major highway that begins at the Kabul axis and ends in Bamyan and Daikundi, as well as along the Baghlan route, which connects the aforementioned provinces to the center of Kabul, based on national priorities. Despite political and ethnic pressures to divert funds to specific routes and regions, the project was implemented in accordance with public needs and national interests. The importance of this project was that it connected several central and northern provinces of Afghanistan with each other and with the capital. Result: - Transportation routes and the movement of merchants' goods between the aforementioned provinces were facilitated, and costs were reduced. - Public satisfaction increased, and people's trust in the government and the ruling system grew. - This project was one of the national projects in the decade (2010-2020) that was implemented regardless of ethnic affiliation. - The connection of the Herat, Badghis, Faryab, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Ghazni routes, where people from the mentioned regions live with different ethnicities and languages, has connected their network, which demonstrates effective leadership free from ethnic interests. - Result: Positive, and its consequences: - Connecting important central, northern, and western provinces, reducing travel costs and facilitating travel for passengers, transporting goods, and increasing trade between provinces. - Widespread public satisfaction and increased trust between the people of the provinces and the center emerged. -Note: If you wish, you can also consider the road network and the connection of the Bamyan, Yakawlang-Kotel-e Qonaq-Nili (the center of Daikundi) and Jaghori routes as part of this large national network. B) Making a decision that was influenced by ethnic bias and had an unsuccessful and ineffective outcome: During the period 2011-2021, actions and measures were taken in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health based on ethnic tendencies, network affiliation, and group affiliation, which: - In the Ministry of Education and Health, appointments and placements of individuals in key positions were made based on ethnic and group affiliation, while specialized and experienced staff were sidelined and individuals lacking experience and expertise were appointed to important and key positions. - In the years 2016-2018, official reports from Faryab, Paktia, Logar, and Takhar provinces showed that: - School construction and textbook printing projects were delayed due to poor management and corruption. - The books were not distributed on time. - Corruption in contracts increased. - Some donor-funded projects were canceled. - This is a clear example of decision-making failure influenced by bias.|Widespread corruption clearly had negative effects on international projects. There are specific examples of projects being delayed due to corruption. The National Rural Water Supply Program project in Uruzgan and Helmand provinces from 2014-2016, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in collaboration with the World Bank, carried out rural water supply projects. According to information (reports) from Uruzgan and Helmand: - Local contractors embezzled part of the budget. - The drilling quality was unsatisfactory, and the water tank preparation was of poor quality. - The financial documents lacked transparency. Result: The World Bank halted the project for several months, and thousands of families were left without access to clean water. Reduced service quality: Health programs in the Ministry of Public Health, in 2017, in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, and Farah, reported that health implementing companies had illegally withdrawn a portion of the budget, which resulted in: - Clinics were left without medicine or medical supplies. - Employe salaries haven't been paid for months. - Maternal and child mortality increased, and the quality of health service delivery severely declined and even collapsed. - Cutting off foreign aid due to corruption: The printing and publication of textbooks in the Ministry of Education in 1397 (solar year) was supported by international donors, especially the European Union. After the exposure of corruption in the printing and publication contracts for hundreds of thousands of textbooks for education students, the following decisions were made: - They completely cut off the budget that had been allocated. - The project's execution was halted pending complete reviews. - Millions of students were unable to receive books in the next academic year. - The Ministry of Education's credibility was questioned and the level of trust in it decreased significantly.|The effects of the gap between formal and traditional institutions. There are clear examples where projects have faced difficulties in implementation due to poor cooperation between formal and traditional institutions. In Baghlan Province - Burka District: Problems and conflicts over the distribution of irrigation canal water in 2015. Without coordinating or consulting with local elders, the government implemented a new water distribution plan. This action resulted in: - Two villages entered into conflict and dispute. - Several acres of land were destroyed. - The canal improvement project was halted for several months. Matters that have been resolved correctly and effectively due to effective cooperation between formal and traditional institutions: In Herat Province, Injil District: Problems and disputes arose between the two families (tribes) regarding irrigated lands. To resolve this issue, the government, in collaboration with the local council, the tribal jirga, the land authorities, held joint meetings and sessions, which resulted in: - The conflict was resolved non-violently. - The land was officially registered by the government. - The irrigation project that was beyond was implemented without any problems.|How foreign aid affects the government's independent decision-making. A) Supportive effects on government decision-making: In the years 2011-2016, the United States and NATO insisted and emphasized the implementation of development budgets in the security sector. Donors insisted that more budget be spent on creating security forces, building bases, and equipping the police. The government was forced to: - Transfer a large portion of development budget from economic and infrastructure projects to security-focused (security) projects. B) Negative consequences and repercussions (contrary to national interests) that resulted in the following: - Economic projects (road construction, energy, agriculture) were underfunded and poorly developed. - The level of economic growth decreased and slowed down. - The country's dependence on foreign aid increased. - It created public dissatisfaction with the lack of development services.|Practical recommendations for the future (Framework for assistance) Based on the lessons learned over the years and real-world experience in Afghan society, how should it be and what should be done? Based on past experiences, it is suggested that international aid to Afghanistan (a post-conflict country) be implemented in a hybrid model. How? - 50% of the aid will be implemented and operationalized thru the national government budget, under the supervision of an independent body, civil society councils, and the media. - 50% of the aid will be implemented thru independent donor projects to reduce the risks of politicization and corruption. Perhaps we can find an example of this model in the Citizen Contract Program (CCNPP), where local community monitoring led to greater transparency and trust. It is also worth noting that at the same time and during that era, the helpers maintained their technical roles, which had a positive outcome.\"\"\"\n",

    "ID_S1_004|10/25/2025 4:19:02|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|2016–2021|After 2001, it was essential for any Afghan leader to enjoy comprehensive rule and strategic legitimacy. First, comprehensive rule was necessary to pursue the unification of Afghanistan's religions, ethnicities, and tribes into a single state and national identity. Years of violent conflict had torn apart the fabric of Afghan society, and almost everywhere in Afghanistan, the risk of destruction from political unrest was higher than usual. Only through leadership that embraces power sharing and representation can Afghanistan hope to achieve a certain level of political stability and social cohesion. Second, as much as reestablishing state authority will be part of the maturation of the Afghan state, strategic legitimacy locally, regionally, and globally will be fundamental to this transformation. Domestic legitimacy has been based on two main objectives: responding to citizens' needs and providing a minimum level of services, and respecting Islamic and traditional values, which are also important elements of domestic legitimacy. Restoring international legitimacy and gaining a certain level of diplomatic credibility requires some ability to counter foreign influence and address negative perceptions of living under the tutelage of external actors and their sovereign powers. Without a legitimate foundation, any government risks being seen as an external power transfer, and the absence of legitimacy undermines any progress toward long-term stability.|Afghan leaders have made progress, but they also have to deal with ongoing challenges in bringing together formal government institutions and traditional institutions like the Loya Jirga and local councils. Programs such as the Loya Jirga and the National Solidarity Program have involved local leaders in some decision-making and development initiatives, although they have not always been effective. In many locations, local loyalties, instability, and lack of government capacity have made it difficult to fully integrate these systems.|Heavy reliance on foreign funding and technical assistance hampered the development of self-reliant and accountable strategic thinking among Afghan leaders, as donors predetermined or influenced a large portion of the budget and major projects. As a result, leaders generally felt compelled to prioritize donor commitments over national priorities. This, in turn, fostered a dependency mindset that stifled initiative and weakened local accountability, as success came to be defined more by satisfying foreign partners than by addressing the realities faced by Afghan citizens.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Neutral|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Neutral|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|Aside from the financial situation, the significant weakness affecting service delivery and policy implementation was the limited capability and expertise in government institutions. Many ministries and local offices did not have qualified staff, systems, or coordination, which ultimately created significant obstacles to mobilize plans into action. This affected timeliness, productivity, and public frustrations across all sectors, including health, education, and infrastructure. |Inability to provide security|An example is Afghanistan's National Solidarity Program (NSP), which empowered people at the community level through Community Development Councils. By engaging with local elders and taking into account customary decision-making processes, the program was culturally appropriate and unearthed community priorities delivering educational, transportation, and water infrastructure. Conversely, programs that did not respect cultural contexts were likely to be rejected by communities, underscoring the critical importance of cultural appropriateness in programming.|The key takeaway from 2001-2021 is that effective and acceptable governance is not created just from external funding or external institutions; it has to be central to local political reality and social trust. In Afghanistan, efforts were primarily centered on creating a formal structure and the institution needed to satisfy donor expectations, yet when institutions lacked legitimacy to traditional leadership, customary practices, and citizen need, they were often presented an illusion of legitimacy. Sustainable governance requires a balance between contemporary state institutions and local authority, security, the provision of basic services, and accountability grounded in the people themselves.|Not provided\n",

People continued to view local solutions as more credible and fair than resorting to official channels.|The most important lesson of this course is that effective and legitimate governance is sustainable when its political and social ownership arises from within the society, not imposed from without. In a country like Afghanistan, legitimacy does not come from the ballot box or international support alone; it requires internal consensus, coherence with the cultural and social context, transparency, and genuine participation of the people in decision-making. Governance is strengthened when formal state structures, local community values, and traditional institutions are connected; stability and legitimacy are undermined when this connection is ignored.|Yes! An important point that has been less addressed is the importance of institutional continuity in the process of state-building in Afghanistan. Experience has shown that extensive, accelerated, and person-centered changes in leadership, diplomacy, and government structures have caused no policy or program to survive. In the absence of continuity, capacities were not accumulated, historical memory was not formed, and each government effectively started from scratch. In my opinion, if policies and institutions had structural stability, a culture of accountability, and a program-centered approach, many domestic and international efforts in the path of state-building in Afghanistan would have had more lasting and effective results.\n",

    "ID_S1_012|10/26/2025 17:36:30|Former Afghan Government Official|2011–2015, 2016–2021|In my opinion, given Afghanistan's unique characteristics, not only over the past 20 years but also in the future, an effective leader can only be effective if, as a first step, they have a cross-ethnic vision for the country and consider Afghanistan to be connected to and dependent on all of its ethnic groups. Second, they must be specialized. To overcome and properly manage the crisis, they must assemble a team of experts to organize matters with complete competence, experience, and understanding. In short, a cross-ethnic vision and a specialized, experience-centered vision are essential characteristics of an effective leader in Afghanistan.|Afghan leaders managed to build relationships between official institutions and traditional structures to some extent, but this balance was unstable. For example, during the reigns of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, the Loya Jirga councils were used for national decision-making, but no sustainable coordination with government institutions was established.|Unfortunately, Afghanistan was completely dependent on aid from the international community, and this total dependence meant that, in times of crisis and decision-making, the country's leaders were unable to make independent decisions based on the national interests of the country. As a result, the outcome and repercussions of this situation were exactly what the United States wanted.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Widespread corruption|I disagree with the lack of financial resources.

It is a very detailed story that cannot be described here.|I think the biggest lesson that can be learned is that if a country like Afghanistan wants to emerge from the crisis, they must be careful in choosing and appointing their leaders, they must vote for people who will work for Afghanistan, and in the second step, the priority of the leaders and all the people should be the collective interests of the country. We voted based on ethnic affiliations, the leaders decided based on their ethnic affiliations, and the result was that the country became more critical. The big lesson is to appoint people based on their competence, honesty, and expertise, not ethnic affiliations, language, etc. In short, post-conflict countries need competent and honest people who prioritize the interests of the country above everything else.|While recalling the issues mentioned above, the most important issue that is vital for Afghanistan is governance away from emotions; over the past few decades, we have tried to turn the country into a battlefield and a conflict between neighbors with emotional policies. Afghanistan will not develop unless a neighbor called Pakistan feels at ease with us. Strategic wisdom dictates that we observe moderation in our relations between India and Pakistan to protect ourselves from possible harm from Pakistan, which we have unfortunately not done so far.\n",
    "ID_S1_013|10/26/2025 17:42:03|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|2011–2015|In my opinion, the two most important qualities for an effective Afghan leader after 2001 were: 1. The ability to build national unity: After years of war and ethnic conflict, an effective leader must be able to build trust and solidarity among different groups, ethnicities, and religions in order to lay the foundations for a sustainable nation-state. 2. Commitment to transparency and fighting corruption: During the reconstruction period in Afghanistan, rampant corruption was one of the main challenges. A leader who emphasizes transparency, accountability, and justice is able to maintain the trust of the people and the international community and make the development process sustainable.|Unfortunately, customs and traditions still prevail in many parts of the country, and tribal values are paramount. On the other hand, during the 20-year republic, some outsiders did not believe in these customs and traditions, and some even showed an excessive desire to use them to polish their image in front of the public by respecting customs and traditions. In my opinion, the result of these trends was a more critical situation in the country. We have multifaceted crises and problems in the country that must be solved with modern science, a specialized perspective, and effective diplomacy, or at least a reasonable solution must be found for them. However, not only did we lack a logical and specialized perspective in this area, but we also wanted to solve the country's most sensitive problems through the Loya Jirga, a council whose members are mostly illiterate or have limited education. In fact, the country's constitution stipulates that the constitution can be amended through the Loya Jirga, although it has its own procedures. In my opinion, after 2001, Afghan leaders were only able to build effective bridges between official state institutions and traditional structures, such as local councils and jirgas, to a limited extent. On the one hand, attempts were made to use traditional structures in decision-making. For example, the 2003 Constitutional Loya Jirga, the Consultative Peace Jirga, and the Jirga for the Release of Taliban Prisoners in subsequent years were examples of using local traditions to legitimize national decisions. These councils helped people feel that they had a stake in the political process. On the other hand, in many cases, a gap remained between the central government and local structures. The government failed to integrate these traditional institutions into the formal system in a sustainable manner. As a result, government decisions were sometimes met with opposition or mistrust at the local level. In short, attempts were made to build links, but these links were not sustainable or institutionalized, and one of the main weaknesses in the Afghan state-building process remained.|Overreliance on international financial and technical assistance has had profound effects on the development of independent strategic thinking among Afghan leaders. On the one hand, this reliance has led to the country's overall planning and decision-making being influenced by the priorities, policies, and interests of donor countries, rather than the real needs of Afghan society. As a result, many leaders focused on attracting foreign support to seize power and manage aid resources, rather than on developing sustainable national strategies. On the other hand, this situation has weakened the culture of domestic accountability; when budgets and resources are mainly provided from abroad, leaders feel less pressure to be accountable to the people. In other words, they derived their legitimacy more from international support than from public satisfaction. As a result, excessive reliance on foreign aid has hindered the growth of intellectual independence, institutional self-sufficiency, and political accountability among the Afghan leadership.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not very effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, rampant corruption, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|In addition to a lack of financial resources, one of the most notable internal weaknesses of Afghan state institutions was their lack of effective administrative and organizational capacities, coupled with rampant corruption.

Leaders and government officials have attempted to use this method to make decisions that address the country's best interests. However, in modern governance, non-traditional institutions that are not formed on the basis of a social contract do not have sufficient authority and credibility to make major decisions at the national level.

Second, he must be honest and accountable to his people—a leader who stands with his people, leads them through their pain, grief, and hopes, and leads them with honesty.|He believes that Afghan leaders have many ways to build an effective relationship between formal government institutions and traditional communities and structures. Most of the time, both systems were in a state of distrust. The executive branch of the high command spent a lot of time on energy, which was important to him. On the other hand, traditional and tribal councils are crowded with government officials, have elders who do not trust them, and are rife with political corruption. In addition, traditional and local councils are more isolated from the armed forces and the opposition. Some political leaders have tried, but unfortunately, their symbolic efforts have been short-lived. In the case of the Loya Jirga, a local jirga was formed, the debate was managed, and everything was symbolic of his policies. Overall, this relationship remained incomplete—neither traditional structures, nor formal government institutions, nor the trust of the people were strengthened.|I believe that the country has relied too heavily on foreign political leaders and financial and technical assistance, which has weakened Afghan leaders' sense of national responsibility and independent strategic thinking. When equipment is the last important part of the organization, we can clearly see how weak mid-level government managers are, as well as their independence, strategic thinking, and responsibility. The sense of ownership of the country and the government has been seriously damaged, and the country has become heavily dependent on foreigners and their financial and technical assistance. After 2016, many leaders tried to reduce dependence on the homeland and restore responsibility. Remember some examples. For example, in 2016, Americans seriously discussed strengthening the country's air force. Similarly, we have only 157 Black Hawk helicopters. The air force has received dozens of transport and large military equipment, giant fighter jets, fighter jets, and bombers. Every six months, dozens of young people in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Europe, and the United States receive training in the Air Force. For example, when the former president seriously discussed the Case Management System (CMS), he took the matter to the US Supreme Court. In front of millions of American citizens, biometric data and its transfer were discussed, the nationality of topographic information was discussed, security responsibilities were transferred, and he also had a lot of work under his control, but he did his best, did not feel ownership, relied on foreign countries, and ultimately paved the way for the fall.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|I believe that the most serious impact is weak internal institutions, corruption, political interference, and weak capacity (capacity gap).

The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) launched the Afghan National Integration Program around 2003 with the help of the World Bank. This program aims to empower villagers to make decisions and develop and implement projects. De Biera's factors: 1. Social values of harmony: The Afghan Rural Council Program, the Jirga Council, and the Partnership should be established. The villagers chose the Shura Council (Village Development Council) and decided to implement the project (road, water, school, bridge, electricity, etc.). 2. Trust and sense of ownership among the people: When the people participated in decision-making, they felt that they were managing the project themselves, not the government or foreigners. Corruption became more difficult. 3. Gradual participation of women: In areas where traditional restrictions exist, the structure of women's councils should be introduced gradually and cautiously. Da Franji prevented conflict and paved the way for Kibledo. The result: more than 35,000 projects benefited from the National Solidarity Program, and thousands of small development projects improved people's lives. The Community Development Program of the World Bank and other institutions is a successful example.

This leader must have strategic leadership and the ability to make decisive decisions in order to pursue a clear strategy for the country's stability, security, and long-term economic growth. A close relationship with the people and a deep understanding of the nation's needs and values are also essential for a leader, as the trust of the people is the foundation of any legitimate system. In addition, the leader of international relations must have the ability to manage effectively, so that the national interests of Afghanistan and its international partners are protected in a balanced manner.|After 2001, the Afghan government leadership faced political and administrative complexities in achieving an effective balance between formal institutions and traditional community structures, namely jirgas and local councils. The political and social reality in Afghanistan shows that traditional structures of legitimacy, arbitration, and social order are based on historical provisions, while formal government institutions represent modern governance, accountability, and the rule of law. Although some leaders have attempted to integrate the two by establishing consultative councils, these efforts have often failed to achieve effective coordination and long-term action. For example, the adoption of the Loya Jirga constitution and the participation of the people is a symbolic example, and the decision itself has not been fully implemented at the political or administrative level of the Loya government. Overall, the efforts of Afghan leaders and formal and informal institutions to build an effective bridge have been limited because they do not appreciate traditions and structures. This should be recognized as an authentic form, not only in modern state-building, but also in line with the principles of a sustainable framework.|His analysis, leadership of Afghanistan, international financial and technical assistance, and heavy reliance on independent strategic thinking and responsiveness had a profound impact on the institution. This dependence has often forced leaders to follow the requirements and conditions of international donors, limiting their ability to make independent, long-term policy decisions. It will also weaken the culture of accountability, because decisions about responsibility and accountability will, in most cases, depend on foreign institutions and their expectations. In addition, reliance on foreign aid has also limited local innovation, capacity building, and national resources based on decision-making capacity, damaging the government's legitimacy and public confidence.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|In addition to limited financial resources, limited human and administrative capacity in Afghan government institutions is one of the biggest internal obstacles that has had a profound impact on service delivery and policy implementation. Many institutions lack sufficient professional staff, administrative skills, and technical skills, limiting their ability to effectively meet the needs of the people. In addition, deficiencies in internal organizational structures, centralized decision-making, high centralization, lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms, and weak inter-agency coordination have prevented the effective implementation of policies. Overall, this internal weakness has not only led to a decline in service quality, but has also created a series of challenges in promoting government legitimacy and public trust, requiring a comprehensive strategic plan for future policymaking and government reforms.|Inability to provide security and rampant corruption|Afghanistan's Women's Rights Development Program, which is an important effort in governance and social reforms after 2001, can be presented as an important example that people have experienced both success and failure with social and cultural values.

This diplomatic example shows that the success of reforms and policies is directly related to the consideration of national and local values, traditions, and social sensitivities.|2001 = 2021 Afghanistan is based on experience, a post-conflict country, the most important thing for effective and legitimate governance is to build government reform and success in internal government capacities, stable security, coordination with national priorities, and respect for society's values |An important issue that has not been paid much attention to in Afghanistan's leadership, diplomacy and state building is the importance of internal trust, social capital, and long-term strategic leadership.

In addition, local leaders, communities, and cultural sensitivities take into account the lack of diplomatic efforts and international cooperation and influence.

    "ID_S2_004|Former Afghan Government Official|During the years 2011-2021, President Ashraf Ghani made a clear decision to support the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Gas Pipeline Project (TAPI Pipeline Project). At that time, Afghanistan was facing serious economic problems, such as energy shortages and restrictions on regional trade. Ashraf Ghani emphasized the priority of national interests and considered the overall interests of the country to be superior to ethnic or regional interests. He actively participated in international negotiations, signed relevant agreements, and approved the necessary internal measures for pipeline construction, such as land use and route selection. Although the project is not yet complete, Ghani's decision has paved the way for the expansion of regional economic cooperation and the creation of job opportunities for the people of Afghanistan, and has given the country international economic credibility. This is an example where national interests took precedence over ethnic interests and had positive outcomes.|Direct experience from a road construction project in Parwan province in 2017 showed how administrative and financial corruption hinders coordination. During the implementation of the contracts for this project, some contracting companies did not properly adhere to road construction standards, and in some sections, only a thin layer of sand was used. According to reports from local people and the press, the project delays and poor road quality were linked to corruption, as contracts were often awarded in the names of influential individuals. As a result, not only was the road quality poor, but coordination between government agencies and international partners was also slow, and service delivery to local people was affected. This example illustrates how corruption can have a serious negative impact on project implementation, service quality, and the coordination system.|A long-standing water distribution problem in Laghman province of Afghanistan has worsened due to poor cooperation between official institutions and local leaders. The provincial Department of Agriculture tried to start the construction project of a canal, but a place for consultation with the local jirgas and councils was not selected.

The government agencies relied solely on administrative orders, without providing opportunities for trust and participation to local leaders. The outcome was that the project was delayed, water distribution conflicts increased, and public dissatisfaction grew. This example illustrates that coordination between formal and traditional structures plays a vital role in resolving local conflicts.|The police building program in Afghanistan is an example where foreign aid had a negative impact against national interests. A lot of money was spent by international donors to fund and equip the police, but not enough attention was given to managing and building the capacity of the Afghan government's security sector.

As a result, there was an increase in police corruption and a weakening of the government system, which had consequences against national interests.|A practical recommendation for Afghanistan's reconstruction is that the international community should implement each aid project thru Afghanistan's national budget and national institutions, rather than having different projects managed by separate donors. This not only prevents the waste of resources but also helps strengthen the country's governmental capacities. A joint fund should be established for aid, with financial oversight and management thru the Ministry of Finance, and project monitoring given to representatives of the community and government. Project implementation should be based on the consultation and participation of local people to ensure their needs are met correctly and to increase project effectiveness. To this end, the transparency of all projects and the monitoring of results should be done thru financial and non-financial audits.

    "ID_S2_009|International Diplomat/Representative of an International Organization|Regarding the transnational leader: In 2020, I was working at the Ministry of Water and Energy as the Director of Water Affairs Regulation for the General Directorate of the Kabul River Basin. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, initiated a move to divide the Ministry of Water and Energy into two agencies: the National Water Affairs Regulatory Authority and the National Energy Affairs Regulatory Authority. From an administrative perspective, this was a positive and national act because Afghanistan produces approximately 75 billion cubic meters of water annually but is unable to utilize 20% of this total due to mismanagement. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a single agency for comprehensive management of water resources to control Afghanistan's water resources thru a strategic plan spanning approximately 5 years and 10 years. Part A: This was a positive step toward economic growth for the country, improving agriculture from the water infrastructure. Part B: This action by the president failed because the president had ethnic and personal motives for two reasons. First, he turned the ministry into an administration because he wanted to be allowed by the constitution to appoint anyone to head an administration without needing a vote from parliament to elect them. Secondly, according to the agreements of the unity government, the Ministry of Water and Energy belonged to Dr. Abdullah. How could he have his close associates in this ministry when he had turned the ministry into a management?|Corruption as an obstacle to coordination, there were two reasons for the president to carry out widespread corruption. First, he appointed someone close to him to head the administration, and thru this, he was able to implement the infrastructure projects for the imaginary water facilities and add their cost to his capital, which he almost did. Or, he contracted and implemented the infrastructure projects for the water facilities with several companies that were from his own people, and he did. I witnessed several projects; a small example of this was the maintenance and care of the Darunta Dam, which cost approximately 53 million Afghanis. This project was contracted by a company from his own people, and it can be said that this project was contracted for 25 million. Secondly, according to the law, the head of the administration was appointed by the president, and this head of the administration was accountable and reported to no one other than the president. Even Parliament, the embodiment of the people's will, did not have the authority to remove or hold them accountable.|Regarding the gap between the formal and dominant institutions, I must say that since the ministries and departments were restructured, the president, according to the constitution, had the authority to choose the head of the department himself. Parliament, which represented the people, had no vote or authority in this process. For this reason, a person close to power or with political influence was usually appointed to head the departments, rather than technical and expert individuals. The person who was appointed only reported to the president and was not accountable to any other institution. For example, in the Surkh Rod district of Nangarhar province (the Sultanpur area), a project to build a protective wall was implemented. I don't remember the exact cost, but it was very high. This project was approved thru the Ministry of Energy and Water at the time. The wall was supposed to be two and a half meters high below ground, hidden from public view, but it was only built to a height of about one and a half meters; another meter remained incomplete, and unsuitable materials were used. When the flood came, the wall collapsed and caused extensive damage to people's land. People complained, but because the head of the department and his close associates were involved at the top of the project, no one dared to follow up. The implementing company was also owned by the head of the department himself and was mostly selected based on ethnic ties. At that time, such disputes were unsolvable because when the project is the government itself and the government's power is behind it, the people have no way to resist. As a result, the problem remained unresolved and no authority had the jurisdiction to investigate.|At the National Water Resources Management Authority where I worked, foreign aid played a very effective role. No independent decisions were made; most projects were funded thru the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and the implementation of the projects depended on these resources. When the Ministry of Energy and Water was transformed into the National Water Regulatory Authority, a new problem arose: the authority was no longer accountable to parliament because its head was appointed by the president and only reported to him. There was no regulatory authority (except for the president himself). For this reason, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank stopped their aid. They said, \"We will not give money to an office that is not accountable and cannot be questioned.\" While the minister was approved by parliament and accountable to the people when the ministry existed. However, the administration lacked such legitimacy, which is why many of the projects that were in the plan were not implemented and remained unfinished.|Based on my experience with the reconstruction situation in Afghanistan, if the international community wants to intervene in post-war countries, it should provide aid thru non-governmental and international organizations (NGOs), not directly thru the government. Because when aid is channeled thru the government, there is usually nepotism, ethnic discrimination, and widespread corruption. The minister gives orders to his close associates, they pass them on to their employes, and the result is that the budget doesn't reach the real people. But in the international model: • A donor entity provides the funds, and a specific institution implements the project. • The second body independently (directly or indirectly) monitors whether the aid has reached the intended recipients. • Separate oversight reduces corruption and increases transparency.

And this incident caused the project to be delayed.|from 2014 to 2017, the Ministry of Public Health, under the leadership of Ferozuddin Feroz and with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), had a program to build rural clinics in the eastern part of the country. However, in Nangarhar province, administrative corruption at the level of the Public Health Directorate and local contractors led to contracts being awarded to affiliated companies and the work being carried out poorly. Many clinics remained unfinished, and the WHO temporarily suspended funding for the project. Administrative corruption hindered people's access to healthcare services and reduced the confidence of donors.|In 2018, the government initiated the Jaghori Dam project in Ghazni province without consulting the people of Andar district. People protested because they said the watercourse passed thru their land and their rights were being ignored. Because government officials did not cooperate with local elders and guilds, tensions escalated and the project was halted for several months. The lack of cooperation between the government and traditional structures caused delays in the project and led to public distrust.|From 2017 to 2020, several development projects in road construction and water supply were implemented in Daikundi province by USAID and UNOPS. Foreign donors themselves determined the routes, companies, and even the type of building materials, without sufficient coordination with the local administration or the people. Local officials suggested the road route pass thru more populated areas so more people could benefit, but because the final decision was made at the Kabul headquarters with the input of foreign consultants, the less beneficial route was chosen. The project was implemented at a high cost but with less benefit.|Afghanistan's experience shows that when decisions are made without consulting the people, transparency, and a national perspective, the outcome is usually failure; whether in ethnic decisions, government and administrative discussions, or projects implemented under foreign influence. Therefore, in any future international intervention, the aid framework should revolve around a few principles: first, national ownership – decisions should be made domestically, with the leadership of the government and local people, not in foreign offices, and not with the ethnic bias of past governments. Second, accountability and transparency – all projects must be implemented thru the national budget to enable monitoring and accountability. Third, public consultation – local councils and community elders should be involved in project design and monitoring from the outset to prevent ethnic and social conflicts. And in the financial resources section, there needs to be very close monitoring and auditing to prevent financial corruption.\n",
    "ID_S2_011|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|About transnational leadership during the National Unity Government or the Republic from 2014-2020 is that the appointment of governors and heads of departments in Ghor was often based on ethnic affiliation and political pressure, not on merit. In several cases, individuals close to specific ethnic factions were appointed to head local departments such as Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Education, and Health. The result was increased ethnic competition between Tajiks, Hazaras, and Pashtuns within the administration, reduced coordination between institutions, many development projects remained unfinished, people lost trust in the administration, and social divisions widened.|Corruption as an obstacle to the coordination of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development's development projects, especially water supply and road construction projects in the province's districts. Contract companies were selected thru the mediation of some local officials, and a large portion of the project budget was embezzled. Some projects were never completed at all, or their quality was very low. As a result, donors like USAID and UNDP halted a portion of the funding, and project implementation was delayed for several years. Local people lost trust in government institutions.|The gap between the formal and traditional institutions of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, which implemented an irrigation project without consulting local jirgas. Because the stream's path passed thru land belonging to another village and their consent had not been obtained, the conflict between the two villages escalated and the project was halted. Several months later, negotiations were resumed with the mediation of tribal elders, but government institutions had already lost their credibility.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic governance in adapting aid projects, particularly in the health and education sectors, which were funded by foreign entities such as USAID and the World Bank. Decision-making regarding priorities and budget was primarily done in Kabul and by foreign entities, without considering the actual needs of the people. Health centers were built in a few districts of the province, but permanent human resources and budget were not provided for them. The projects were seemingly completed but closed down after a few months. This dependence on external decisions made the local government feel powerless to manage independently.|Practical recommendations for the future based on my personal experiences. Aid should be managed and monitored thru local councils, namely Jirgas and Development Councils, not just from Kabul or foreign institutions. Local people should have a direct role in all stages, from planning to consumption. The reason is that in projects where the people of Ghor were involved in decision-making, such as some national solidarity and citizenship programs, there was less corruption and the work was actually completed. However, in projects where decisions were made in Kabul or by foreigners, more funds were wasted and there was no accountability.\n",

Mr. Fazli had studied nursing and did not have the understanding and knowledge of a large and important structure like the Presidential Affairs Department. Their selection was based on ethnicity and proximity to Ghani.|Aid and funding organizations for Afghan projects have always complained about corruption within the structures and were well aware of its widespread presence. The majority of Afghanistan's development projects were supported by the international community and implemented by state-owned companies, which were not executed properly due to wasted project budgets, leading to low project quality. For example, the Kabul-Kandahar road was built with low-quality materials and was very inefficient, deteriorating sooner than the standard they had set.|Ghani had a dual perspective. In its own ethnic structure, there was no problem with local councils. The Jirga somehow saw itself as the guarantor of power's firmness, but the ethnic, local organizations and ethnic Jirgas of other ethnic groups were seen as a threat to its power, and it said, \"We can no longer tolerate the 'island of power'.\" The reason for Ghani's conflict with other ethnic groups caused people not to support Ghani's government and further widened the gap between the government and the nation.

    "ID_S2_016|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|During the rule of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan under Presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, senior officials served who prioritized national interests over ethnic, partisan, and religious interests. A prime example of this could be the extension of the security agreement between the Afghan government and NATO, which resulted in national security and national interests being guarantyd for a specific period. In contrast, a limited number of party leaders working within the government structure prioritized ethnic interests over national interests, and their ethnic policies widened divisions among the people, ultimately undermining national unity. Political parties active in Afghanistan were operating with an expanding ethnic agenda to attract supporters and win elections. Parties should not have considered ethnic, regional, linguistic, religious, or other factors that harm national interests and unity as criteria for their activities. As a result, division among the people increased and hopes for a bright future diminished. Afghanistan's credibility with the international community diminished and international aid was limited. Because most of these aids were misused by these individuals, and the path to Afghanistan's growth and development was challenged.|One sector that did not yield positive results due to widespread administrative corruption was Afghanistan's education sector. Due to the existence of ghost schools and teachers, most of the government's money and budget was embezzled by ministers and senior officials. Cases of administrative corruption in Afghan courts speak to the widespread corruption and lack of transparency. International aid, without effective accountability from ministry leaders, led to delays in the delivery of international assistance and a decline in the quality of education in the country.|International aid provided to Afghanistan should have been implemented in full coordination with the local people thru beneficial projects. Most areas of Afghanistan lack access to safe water, and projects implemented by international NGOs like DACAAR to improve access to safe water often faced implementation difficulties due to local conflicts. Every village or location wanted to implement these projects in their areas, but due to budget constraints, it was difficult for the aid received to reach all vulnerable areas. In many cases, local people prevented the implementation of foreign projects due to security concerns and the activities of armed opponents in their areas. In some cases, these issues were resolved in coordination with local CDC councils, and the local people provided specific conditions to allow these projects to be adapted. For example, the water supply project in Badakhshan and Kunar provinces, which were insecure and had limited access to the government, was implemented with the advice and coordination of local councils because these were humanitarian aid and did not pursue political goals, so the local people allowed the implementation. In conflict-ridden areas, there are widespread disputes over water sources, including the legal ownership of these water resources, which is contested by local people. This has caused project implementation to be delayed or halted.|On the one hand, foreign aid played a very important and vital role for the Afghan government and people in the post-civil war period. However, most of this aid was implemented without oversight and at the discretion of the donor countries, and the Afghan people were unaware of the amount of this aid and how it was spent. Civil activists have mostly expressed their concern that the lack of transparency in the use of domestic budgets and international aid undermines the effectiveness of these contributions. In some cases, donor countries often prioritized their national interests over foreign aid. For example, the aid provided by the Iranian government to the office of Hamid Karzai's government was due to American political and military competition, and they demanded their interests in return for this aid from the Afghan government. The aid that the Indian government continued to provide for the development of Afghanistan was aimed at weakening Pakistan's regional role in the Afghan issue. These factors, which exacerbated regional conflict and competition with neighboring countries, ultimately had a significant impact on national interests and security.|The main recommendation for improving international aid delivery by the global community is to provide transparent mechanisms for implementing these projects so that accountability for these projects is clear to the people. This aid should be under the direct supervision of the people, and the basic priorities of the people should be considered in the preparation of development plans. Afghanistan is in dire need of international aid. Afghanistan is not a poor country and is not in dire need of international aid. The government cannot handle this humanitarian crisis alone, and the international community must continue its assistance. Foreign aid provided by international aid organizations did not reduce poverty in the country due to a lack of transparency, and public distrust of this aid increased. Afghanistan is still an economically weak country, and according to international statistics, Afghanistan faces a harsh winter, making a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan still possible. In order for foreign institutional aid to be effectively implemented in the country, an effective accountability mechanism must be established in coordination with the government, civil society, and people's representatives so that this aid can be effectively implemented and Afghanistan can potentially achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n",

If we assume this statement is correct and disregard the existence of a concept called \"leader\" in Afghanistan, and consider an action that transcends one's nationality, we can cite the recognition of education by private institutions in the country as an effective measure. This decision was made and implemented by President Karzai and, in my opinion, is considered one of the lasting and historic actions for the country.| Very clearly and openly, Afghanistan is considered one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This incorrect historical pattern has a history dating back to the country's contemporary era, but it reached its peak during the decade of democracy. It's very difficult to provide an example of corruption! You might think that if there was so much widespread corruption, why would it be difficult to find such an example? The answer is that in all government projects, corruption was considered part of the job and was so institutionalized that no work could be considered exempt from corruption. Therefore, I mention the Ministry of Public Health's health project as an example. In the implementation of this important project, corruption was rampant and multi-faceted, which both delayed the project's completion and led to the ineffective use of international community aid.|One of the fundamental problems in Afghanistan is the conflict between tradition and modernity. This conflict manifests itself in various forms, sometimes as the government versus traditional society, and at other times in other forms such as modern education and schools, and so on. A large portion of unfinished projects and actions have been due to this conflict. If you look at the annual budget codes, you'll notice that a large portion of the allocated budgets hasn't been used. When you investigate the reason, you'll find that the local people have prevented the project from being implemented, saying it doesn't align with our traditions and customs. Specifically, I can mention the non-implementation of school construction projects in Khost and Logar provinces.|The Geneva meetings and the setting of 21 indicators by donors directly subordinated Afghanistan's policymaking and budget to foreign priorities. Instead of genuine reform, the government manipulated figures and engaged in a superficial fight against corruption to maintain the flow of aid. This process eliminated independent decision-making, institutionalized financial dependence, and sacrificed national interests for the sake of continued foreign aid.|Aid should be spent 100% thru the national budget and under local community oversight, rather than directly injecting currency and creating dependency, and the focus should be on strengthening domestic capacities.

For example, in the education sector in every province of Afghanistan, and similarly in every school at the provincial level, there were dozens and hundreds of fictitious teachers (there were no teachers at all). The name of the teacher was all that existed. Money and national budgets were embezzled by individuals at the leadership and management levels of the education sector.

These lands do not have official municipal documents, only customary ones. The government declared them public, and people began construction in this area. The municipality and land administration did not allow people to build here, but people started construction by paying money or using their connections with members of parliament or high-ranking officials of official institutions. However, this institution was unable or unwilling to solve the people's problems at their root, and now, with nearly a thousand homes built, they still lack municipal deeds and maps, and the government considers this land its own. Now the government is in trouble. If it demolishes all these houses, it will cost the government a lot of money, and the people will also be in a state of uncertainty and confusion. This indicates gaps in formal and legal institutions.|In Afghanistan, the president was appointed by the United States of America in consultation with the European Union.

However, the voter turnout was really low; the election site staff were just hoping someone would come and cast their vote.|If the international community wants to intervene in a post-conflict country, I have a few recommendations: 1) It must create strong, impartial infrastructure that is in line with the country's culture (such as transparent laws, the rule of law, impartial and accountable election monitoring bodies). 2) If other international organizations provide financial and humanitarian aid, instead of distributing it directly to the people, they should create employment opportunities, for example, by assisting and reviving sectors such as agriculture, handicrafts, and tourism, so that people can become self-sufficient and overcome their problems. 3) Establishing independent, impartial, and accountable media outlets for the people. 4) Establishing democratic institutions where the people themselves can choose their own destiny and their own leader. 5) Local people should have a role in how aid is distributed or consumed. 6) Instead of being consumptive, the focus on how aid is used should be developmental and infrastructural. 7) Instead of being distributed thru NGOs, aid should be created in the form of an agricultural bank or reconstruction. For example, it wants to provide low-interest loans to individuals in the agricultural sector or other businesses. If these individuals are successful, they will be given more loans or their interest will be waived so that people are encouraged to solve their own problems instead of always relying on aid.\n",
    "ID_S2_020|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|President Hamid Karzai's 2013 decision to jointly recruit young people from different ethnic groups to expand the national army is an example where national interests were prioritized over ethnic interests, resulting in a relatively positive outcome. Conversely, the decisions of some politicians during the 2019-2020 elections, which were based on ethnic biases, led to unsuccessful outcomes. a) National interests take precedence over ethnic interests - positive example • Background: From 2011 to 2014, the security situation in Afghanistan was poor and the withdrawal of international forces had been announced. It was necessary for the army and national police to be able to defend the entire country. • Action: Hamid Karzai announced a program to expand the national army, under which young people from different ethnic groups were recruited jointly. The recruitment process was intentionally designed to represent all of Afghanistan instead of a specific ethnic group. • Result: A relative balance was created in the camp's structure, which strengthened the sense of national identity and increased its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. Although problems remained, this decision reflected a transnational vision. b) Decision based on ethnic preferences – a failed example • Background: In the 2019-2020 elections, there was intense competition among political groups. Some high-ranking officials were making decisions to appease their ethnic supporters. • Action: Some politicians, whose support was based on ethnicity, opposed the election results and declared a parallel government. Instead of supporting transparent trends and national unity, decisions became subject to ethnic preferences. • Result: A legitimacy crisis was created, public trust in the government decreased, and the ground was prepared for the Taliban to regroup. This is a clear example of the negative consequences of a lack of national vision.|The Kabul Bank case – a clear example of corruption • Background: Kabul Bank was the largest private bank in Afghanistan and was used to pay salaries and finance development projects. International aid and government financial programs were primarily channeled thru this bank. • Action: Between 2010 and 2013, senior bank officials and individuals close to the government illegally withdrew approximately billion for personal gain. This corruption occurred thru fake loans, personal expenses, and funding political networks. • Result: Projects were halted: Educational and health projects whose salaries and budgets were paid thru Kabul Bank were delayed for several months. The quality of services decreased: Teachers and doctors were unable to continue working due to not receiving their salaries, and the quality of educational and health services declined. Cutting off foreign aid: International partners, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF), suspended aid programs to Afghanistan until the government takes serious action against corruption. By October 2012, only a small portion of the stolen money had been recovered, severely damaging global trust. Consonance obstacle (harmony) • This case showed that corruption is not just a domestic problem, but also erodes the trust of international partners. • The cessation and cutting of aid destroyed the atmosphere of cooperation between the government and the world and became a major obstacle to development projects. Result: The Kabul Bank scandal is a clear answer to this question: corruption causes project delays, reduces service quality, and cuts off foreign aid. This experience proves that the lack of transparency and accountability is the biggest obstacle to coordinating development programs.|The gap between formal and traditional institutions • Province: Helmand • Problem: Conflict over water resources (Helmand River water division) Explanation :In Helmand province, the water distribution problem worsened due to poor cooperation between government agencies and traditional local councils. • Background: The Helmand River's seawater is of vital importance for agriculture. There was no coordination between the government's official programs and the traditional decisions of the local elders. • Result: Water disputes increased, some areas faced water scarcity, and agricultural production decreased. The lack of joint decision-making between formal and traditional institutions hindered problem-solving. Positive control sample • Province: Nangarhar • Problem: Property dispute • Result: Due to effective cooperation between the state court and the local jirga, the land dispute was resolved jointly and both parties accepted the decision. Result: These examples show that when there is no cooperation (like in Helmand), conflicts are prolonged. But when cooperation is effective (like in Nangarhar), the problem is solved relatively successfully.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic autonomy . Example: The 2013-2015 security strategy, which was based on US and NATO assistance. Background • Due to the withdrawal of international forces (2014), the Afghan government was forced to design a large part of its security strategy and budget based on US and NATO aid. • The priority of global war contributors with the Taliban was to help and maintain major cities, not to create widespread local stability. Action • The focus of the national security strategy was placed on cities and highways, as requested by global partners. • Security funding was reduced for remote areas because donors controlled resource allocation according to their own priorities. Negative consequences • Contrary to national interests: The government's need was to secure the villages, but due to external pressure, security was only concentrated in the cities. • Result: The Taliban's influence in remote areas increased. The government's legitimacy decreased. Instead of long-term stability, a short-term defensive strategy was formed that was at odds with national interests. Result: This example shows that when national policy is subject to the priorities of foreign donors, the government's strategic independence is weakened, and the outcome is detrimental to national interests.|Practical advice for the future. Recommendation: Aid should be spent thru the \"national single budget,\" but under the transparent oversight of local people and with independent accountability mechanisms. How to make it practical • 1. National Unified Budget Framework: All global aid must be spent thru the official government budget, not thru separate donor projects. This prevents the creation of parallel offices and ensures coordination with national programs. • 2. Local Monitoring: At the provincial and district levels, people's councils or civil society organizations should monitor the implementation of projects. This reduces corruption and increases public trust. • 3. Independent Accounting: A common accounting system should be established for the use of aid, involving the government, global donors, and civil society. Reasons based on failures • During the reconstruction of Afghanistan, much of the aid was spent outside the government budget, resulting in: or creating parallel offices, or weakening the government's legitimacy, the increase in corruption, and the loss of public trust. Reasons based on successes • Projects implemented thru national budgets and under public supervision (such as some rural development projects) were relatively successful because people considered them \"their own projects.\" Result: To succeed in war-torn countries, aid must be channeled solely thru the national budget and be spent under public oversight and an independent accounting system. This framework prevents corruption, strengthens government legitimacy, and increases public trust.\n",

For example, US aid and equipment for the training and education of the national army, which was entirely dependent on them, did not benefit the people much, and ultimately, the forces they deployed, Units 01 and 02, were deployed by them based on strategic decisions and plans that the government had not prepared or trained for, and ultimately, the US government took them with them. He took them with him, calling them his created and trained forces, not because they were being used effectively in Afghanistan's security affairs.|Afghanistan should have a thorough situation analysis based on impartial monitoring and surveys. Based on the analysis results and the situation, aid should be pledged to Afghanistan and transferred to Afghanistan thru Afghanistan's own national budget, and the use of this budget in Afghanistan should be monitored to prevent corruption in its expenditure. In other words, the institution or donor that is cooperating, or the international community itself, should closely monitor how its cooperation is being used. This is how monetary and financial corruption is prevented and a positive change is brought about in the work process.|\n",
    "ID_S2_022|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|A clear example of both states can be found during the Republic era (2011-2021). For example, we can recall Ashraf Ghani's decision to sign a security agreement with the United States, which he stated aimed to prioritize national interests over ethnic interests. Karzai refused to sign the treaty, but Hanif Atmar, the then foreign minister, signed the treaty on behalf of Ashraf Ghani in 2014. After the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the debate over signing a \"Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA)\" with the United States was heated. Hamid Karzai refused to sign it, considering it contrary to national independence. However, at the beginning of the National Unity Government, despite political pressure from various ethnic factions, Ashraf Ghani decided to sign it. Ashraf Ghani stated that the purpose of this action was to ensure the survival of the government structure and security forces, maintain financial aid, and prevent a security vacuum. Many Pashtun-centric figures within the government and Karzai's circle opposed it by signing, but Ghani called it a \"national necessity.\" After signing this agreement, Western financial and military support for the Afghan government continued until 2021, and the Nano mission to assist and equip the national army continued. The signing of this treaty strengthened the international legitimacy of the Afghan government. Although this decision sparked criticism, it was a rare example of prioritizing national interests (in line with the survival of the republican system and the country's security) despite ethnic and political pressures, and it had positive short-term results. It is worth mentioning that Rahmatullah Nabil (former head of national security) also opposed political and ethnic pressures multiple times during his tenure as head of national security (2014-2016) and emphasized strengthening national and non-ethnic structures within the intelligence services. His opposition to the release of some Taliban figures, particularly due to political and ethnic pressures, was a sign of prioritizing national interests over ethnic interests. Nabil's resignation in protest against Ashraf Ghani's personal and discriminatory policies (during his visit to Pakistan) was a sign of his nationalist stance. b) Ethnically biased and exclusionary decisions (2017-2020). During Ashraf Ghani's second term as president, appointments in security institutions – particularly the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the National Directorate of Security – took on a distinctly ethnic flavor. Many commanders and governors were appointed based on the criterion of \"ethnic loyalty,\" regardless of their professional and technical competence. for example, in 2018, Ashraf Ghani appointed General Tariq Shah Bahrami (affiliated with a specific ethnic circle) as Minister of Defense instead of Abdullah Habibi. These changes, along with the gradual removal of Tajik and Uzbek commanders from security structures, sparked strong political reactions in the north of the country. This displacement weakened cohesion within the security forces and widened the gap between the northern forces and the central government. These decisions also undermined trust within the resistance fronts against the Taliban, ultimately leading to the rapid fall of provinces in 2021 as a result of the collapse of the chain of command and lack of coordination among the forces. This type of ethnocentric decision-making was an example of ethnic interests overriding national interests, which led to the weakening of the security structure and the collapse of the republican system. At the end of his second term, instead of strengthening national institutions, Hamid Karzai (President until 2014) strengthened a network of ethnic and local commanders to maintain his ethnic influence in the south of the country. In appointing governors and security officials, he prioritized ethnic balance over merit, and instead of strengthening \"nation-building,\" he pursued a policy of \"ethnic appeasement\" to ensure his political survival. These decisions of his had bad consequences and It rooted the culture of ethnic dealing in the government structure and passed it on to the next government. It then became clear that these Karzai programs were steps toward paving the way for the Taliban, until Ghani completed Karzai's unfinished mission by handing over the Arg to the Taliban. Amrullah Saleh (Ashraf Ghani's first deputy and former national security chief), despite his anti-terrorism and nationalist record, spoke from an ethnic perspective in the final years of his cooperation with Ghani, contributing to the polarization of the political atmosphere. Also, some of his statements and positions on social media, instead of emphasizing \"national convergence,\" sometimes took on an ethnic and linguistic tone. Such positions reduced the capacity for national unity within the anti-Taliban resistance front in the final days of the Republic.|No response|A clear example of this type of project can be explained in Nangarhar province, where the dispute was over water distribution in the Serekan (Spin Ghar) district. Between 2016 and 2019, the dispute between the farmers of two villages over the distribution of water from the \"Kameh\" irrigation canal intensified due to a lack of coordination between the Nangarhar Water Basin Department and local councils. Because the government had changed the canal route without consulting local influentials, local conflicts erupted and agricultural lands remained dry for several months. In contrast, a project in Bamyan province can be mentioned where the dispute over the boundary of agricultural lands in the village of \"Shiber\" (2018-2019) was resolved thru dialog. In this case, close cooperation between the Bamyan Department of Agriculture and local elders led to the establishment of a mediation committee, resolving the dispute peacefully thru dialog.|A specific example of this project was the decision-making process regarding the implementation of the \"TAPI\" project (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline) around the years 2015-2021, with the Asian Development Bank and the government of Turkmenistan as donors. Explanation: The Afghan government, under pressure and encouragement from foreign donors, especially the Asian Development Bank, prioritized the advancement of the TAPI project to be recognized as a regionally supported energy transit route. However, in practice, insecurity along the project route and the lack of guarantyd real benefits for the people of Afghanistan led to national investment in domestic energy infrastructure (such as electricity generation from northern gas or domestic dams) being overlooked. The failure of this project to materialize had negative consequences. This project never materialized, diverting government attention from more urgent domestic projects, increasing Afghanistan's political dependence on regional countries; as a result, Afghanistan's national interests were sacrificed to the geopolitical priorities of the donors.|Aid should be 100% channeled thru the government's national budget and monitored by the local people, not thru separate donor projects. Practical advice: In any post-war reconstruction program, before allocating funds and starting projects, a \"tripartite partnership structure\" must be established between the central government, local institutions, and civil society to ensure joint decision-making on priorities and monitoring of implementation. One successful example of this project was the Citizen Covenant program. In the \"Citizenship Covenant\" program (2016-2020), when village development councils participated in decision-making about small projects (such as roads or schools), the projects were implemented on time and with quality. However, in projects that were planned solely by ministries or foreign donors (such as some World Bank projects in the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development), work either stopped or the quality decreased due to local distrust and administrative corruption. This poor quality of projects will be resolved when they have genuine participation. This showed that without the genuine participation of the people and local leaders in design and monitoring, no foreign aid, even if it amounts to billions of dollars, will be sustainable or used effectively.\n",
    "ID_S2_023|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|Multinational countries and diverse societies need leaders who have a national and transnational vision to facilitate peaceful coexistence among all ethnic groups and various socio-political groups in light of the country/society's prevailing laws. My visit, along with that of former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, with the perspective of prioritizing ethnic interests, paved the way in 2021 for the downfall of a legitimate, inclusive government in favor of a specific ethnic group (the Taliban), both of whom are from the same ethnic background (Pashtun). He removed experienced and influential individuals from the ranks of the security forces and civil positions, gradually handed over districts to the Taliban one after another, and finally brought an end to the 20-year Republic with his own escape.|Many international partners were involved in the corruption of high-ranking Afghan officials, and in many cases, they prevented their prosecution by judicial and legal institutions. In my opinion, the hypothesis that widespread corruption was the main obstacle to cooperation between the government and international partners is incorrect. On the contrary, high-ranking government officials and most of their international partners were complicit in widespread corruption, including the law, police, judiciary, prosecution, parliament, and the military. Everything was under the control of this corrupt gang; there was no second authority to hold them accountable, and everyone was in cahoots. I have personally seen dozens of infrastructure projects that, despite consuming huge sums of money, have not lasted due to poor quality and are currently unusable.|One of the main reasons for the lack of institutionalization of laws in Afghanistan's various systems has been these traditional tribal structures, and in many cases, despite the clarity of the law, disputes were resolved by local elders, which often resulted in injustice in the decisions of local councils and tribal elders' assemblies. Traditional and tribal structures have never been supportive of the rule of law in the country; on the contrary, these structures have weakened the law.|Exactly, governments dependent on foreign aid are not independent in their decision-making. For example: The extraction of the Aynak copper mine in Logar province was awarded by the then government to a Chinese company, but due to the disagreements and conflicts between China and Western countries, led by the United States, and because the Chinese company was also the financial backer of the then government, the extraction of this national project was not allowed to be realized, and the government was obliged to follow the policies and guidelines of the United States.|Not all countries are in the same state after a war; some may need to rebuild buildings, roads, bridges, and highways. However, some of these countries may have a serious need and priority for education, promoting the rule of law, strengthening national unity, raising citizens' knowledge levels, avoiding violence, and so on. Okay. In any case, international aid should be distributed and used thru the government institutions of the war-torn country with international supervision.\n",

However, with the intervention of a politician who sought to profit from the project, the project was never implemented.|Province: Balkh :Type of problem: Water resource conflict (agricultural irrigation)In 2019, a dispute arose in Chamtal district of Balkh province between the two villages of Chashma Shirin and Aq Kupruk over the distribution of water from the Balkhab River. The Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Directorate, without consulting the village council and local elders, decided to change the water distribution route in the secondary canal to help the new irrigation project. Local leaders and the local council considered this decision unilateral and contrary to the previous agreement, and prevented its implementation. The government was also unable to implement the decision without local support. Result : The channel remained closed for about two months. Agricultural lands in both villages were dry and damaged. Physical and armed clashes occurred between young people from two villages, and several people were injured. The issue was only temporarily resolved after a joint council was formed between the government and local elders.|It is clear that non-discretionary budgets (foreign aid) have a negative impact on the independent decision-making of government institutions. A specific answer will be provided below. Decision Topic: Increasing the size of security forces beyond the country's financial capacity Time: 2011-2014. Effective Donor: United States and NATO. Area: Security Policy and National Budget. Following the Chicago and Tokyo conferences, international donors, particularly the United States, emphasized the rapid increase in the number of Afghan security forces (army and police) to approximately 352,000 personnel. This decision was based more on NATO's military objectives than on an assessment of Afghanistan's economic and administrative capacity. Why was it against national interests? The Afghan government had warned that the national budget could not afford to pay the salaries, logistics, and maintenance of this number of troops, but accepted the proposal due to its dependence on foreign aid. Negative consequences: Creating strong financial dependence; over 90% of security expenditures were paid for by foreign aid. After aid was reduced in the years 1398-1400, livelihoods and equipping units faced difficulties. Inability to maintain expensive equipment and aircraft that could only be operated by foreign specialists. Decreased morale and the collapse of the command structure in the final months of the regime.|The intervention of the international community should be contingent on non-interference in political and economic decision-making. Foreign aid should be provided with full transparency and comprehensive oversight. Prevent rent-seeking. The information vacuum is filled and independent institutions are formed for oversight.\n",
    "ID_S2_025|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|: A) In short and concise terms, a decision by a senior Afghan government official that prioritized national interests over ethnic interests, and which had positive results, led the government to decide in the years 2011-2021 to implement the important infrastructure project of constructing a major highway that begins at the Kabul axis and ends in Bamyan and Daikundi, as well as along the Baghlan route, which connects the aforementioned provinces to the center of Kabul, based on national priorities. Despite political and ethnic pressures to divert funds to specific routes and regions, the project was implemented in accordance with public needs and national interests. The importance of this project was that it connected several central and northern provinces of Afghanistan with each other and with the capital. Result: - Transportation routes and the movement of merchants' goods between the aforementioned provinces were facilitated, and costs were reduced. - Public satisfaction increased, and people's trust in the government and the ruling system grew. - This project was one of the national projects in the decade (2010-2020) that was implemented regardless of ethnic affiliation. - The connection of the Herat, Badghis, Faryab, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Ghazni routes, where people from the mentioned regions live with different ethnicities and languages, has connected their network, which demonstrates effective leadership free from ethnic interests. - Result: Positive, and its consequences: - Connecting important central, northern, and western provinces, reducing travel costs and facilitating travel for passengers, transporting goods, and increasing trade between provinces. - Widespread public satisfaction and increased trust between the people of the provinces and the center emerged. -Note: If you wish, you can also consider the road network and the connection of the Bamyan, Yakawlang-Kotel-e Qonaq-Nili (the center of Daikundi) and Jaghori routes as part of this large national network. B) Making a decision that was influenced by ethnic bias and had an unsuccessful and ineffective outcome: During the period 2011-2021, actions and measures were taken in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health based on ethnic tendencies, network affiliation, and group affiliation, which: - In the Ministry of Education and Health, appointments and placements of individuals in key positions were made based on ethnic and group affiliation, while specialized and experienced staff were sidelined and individuals lacking experience and expertise were appointed to important and key positions. - In the years 2016-2018, official reports from Faryab, Paktia, Logar, and Takhar provinces showed that: - School construction and textbook printing projects were delayed due to poor management and corruption. - The books were not distributed on time. - Corruption in contracts increased. - Some donor-funded projects were canceled. - This is a clear example of decision-making failure influenced by bias.|Widespread corruption clearly had negative effects on international projects. There are specific examples of projects being delayed due to corruption. The National Rural Water Supply Program project in Uruzgan and Helmand provinces from 2014-2016, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in collaboration with the World Bank, carried out rural water supply projects. According to information (reports) from Uruzgan and Helmand: - Local contractors embezzled part of the budget. - The drilling quality was unsatisfactory, and the water tank preparation was of poor quality. - The financial documents lacked transparency. Result: The World Bank halted the project for several months, and thousands of families were left without access to clean water. Reduced service quality: Health programs in the Ministry of Public Health, in 2017, in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, and Farah, reported that health implementing companies had illegally withdrawn a portion of the budget, which resulted in: - Clinics were left without medicine or medical supplies. - Employe salaries haven't been paid for months. - Maternal and child mortality increased, and the quality of health service delivery severely declined and even collapsed. - Cutting off foreign aid due to corruption: The printing and publication of textbooks in the Ministry of Education in 1397 (solar year) was supported by international donors, especially the European Union. After the exposure of corruption in the printing and publication contracts for hundreds of thousands of textbooks for education students, the following decisions were made: - They completely cut off the budget that had been allocated. - The project's execution was halted pending complete reviews. - Millions of students were unable to receive books in the next academic year. - The Ministry of Education's credibility was questioned and the level of trust in it decreased significantly.|The effects of the gap between formal and traditional institutions. There are clear examples where projects have faced difficulties in implementation due to poor cooperation between formal and traditional institutions. In Baghlan Province - Burka District: Problems and conflicts over the distribution of irrigation canal water in 2015. Without coordinating or consulting with local elders, the government implemented a new water distribution plan. This action resulted in: - Two villages entered into conflict and dispute. - Several acres of land were destroyed. - The canal improvement project was halted for several months. Matters that have been resolved correctly and effectively due to effective cooperation between formal and traditional institutions: In Herat Province, Injil District: Problems and disputes arose between the two families (tribes) regarding irrigated lands. To resolve this issue, the government, in collaboration with the local council, the tribal jirga, the land authorities, held joint meetings and sessions, which resulted in: - The conflict was resolved non-violently. - The land was officially registered by the government. - The irrigation project that was beyond was implemented without any problems.|How foreign aid affects the government's independent decision-making. A) Supportive effects on government decision-making: In the years 2011-2016, the United States and NATO insisted and emphasized the implementation of development budgets in the security sector. Donors insisted that more budget be spent on creating security forces, building bases, and equipping the police. The government was forced to: - Transfer a large portion of development budget from economic and infrastructure projects to security-focused (security) projects. B) Negative consequences and repercussions (contrary to national interests) that resulted in the following: - Economic projects (road construction, energy, agriculture) were underfunded and poorly developed. - The level of economic growth decreased and slowed down. - The country's dependence on foreign aid increased. - It created public dissatisfaction with the lack of development services.|Practical recommendations for the future (Framework for assistance) Based on the lessons learned over the years and real-world experience in Afghan society, how should it be and what should be done? Based on past experiences, it is suggested that international aid to Afghanistan (a post-conflict country) be implemented in a hybrid model. How? - 50% of the aid will be implemented and operationalized thru the national government budget, under the supervision of an independent body, civil society councils, and the media. - 50% of the aid will be implemented thru independent donor projects to reduce the risks of politicization and corruption. Perhaps we can find an example of this model in the Citizen Contract Program (CCNPP), where local community monitoring led to greater transparency and trust. It is also worth noting that at the same time and during that era, the helpers maintained their technical roles, which had a positive outcome.\"\"\"\n",

    "ID_S1_004|10/25/2025 4:19:02|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|2016–2021|After 2001, it was essential for any Afghan leader to enjoy comprehensive rule and strategic legitimacy. First, comprehensive rule was necessary to pursue the unification of Afghanistan's religions, ethnicities, and tribes into a single state and national identity. Years of violent conflict had torn apart the fabric of Afghan society, and almost everywhere in Afghanistan, the risk of destruction from political unrest was higher than usual. Only through leadership that embraces power sharing and representation can Afghanistan hope to achieve a certain level of political stability and social cohesion. Second, as much as reestablishing state authority will be part of the maturation of the Afghan state, strategic legitimacy locally, regionally, and globally will be fundamental to this transformation. Domestic legitimacy has been based on two main objectives: responding to citizens' needs and providing a minimum level of services, and respecting Islamic and traditional values, which are also important elements of domestic legitimacy. Restoring international legitimacy and gaining a certain level of diplomatic credibility requires some ability to counter foreign influence and address negative perceptions of living under the tutelage of external actors and their sovereign powers. Without a legitimate foundation, any government risks being seen as an external power transfer, and the absence of legitimacy undermines any progress toward long-term stability.|Afghan leaders have made progress, but they also have to deal with ongoing challenges in bringing together formal government institutions and traditional institutions like the Loya Jirga and local councils. Programs such as the Loya Jirga and the National Solidarity Program have involved local leaders in some decision-making and development initiatives, although they have not always been effective. In many locations, local loyalties, instability, and lack of government capacity have made it difficult to fully integrate these systems.|Heavy reliance on foreign funding and technical assistance hampered the development of self-reliant and accountable strategic thinking among Afghan leaders, as donors predetermined or influenced a large portion of the budget and major projects. As a result, leaders generally felt compelled to prioritize donor commitments over national priorities. This, in turn, fostered a dependency mindset that stifled initiative and weakened local accountability, as success came to be defined more by satisfying foreign partners than by addressing the realities faced by Afghan citizens.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Neutral|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Neutral|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|Aside from the financial situation, the significant weakness affecting service delivery and policy implementation was the limited capability and expertise in government institutions. Many ministries and local offices did not have qualified staff, systems, or coordination, which ultimately created significant obstacles to mobilize plans into action. This affected timeliness, productivity, and public frustrations across all sectors, including health, education, and infrastructure. |Inability to provide security|An example is Afghanistan's National Solidarity Program (NSP), which empowered people at the community level through Community Development Councils. By engaging with local elders and taking into account customary decision-making processes, the program was culturally appropriate and unearthed community priorities delivering educational, transportation, and water infrastructure. Conversely, programs that did not respect cultural contexts were likely to be rejected by communities, underscoring the critical importance of cultural appropriateness in programming.|The key takeaway from 2001-2021 is that effective and acceptable governance is not created just from external funding or external institutions; it has to be central to local political reality and social trust. In Afghanistan, efforts were primarily centered on creating a formal structure and the institution needed to satisfy donor expectations, yet when institutions lacked legitimacy to traditional leadership, customary practices, and citizen need, they were often presented an illusion of legitimacy. Sustainable governance requires a balance between contemporary state institutions and local authority, security, the provision of basic services, and accountability grounded in the people themselves.|Not provided\n",

People continued to view local solutions as more credible and fair than resorting to official channels.|The most important lesson of this course is that effective and legitimate governance is sustainable when its political and social ownership arises from within the society, not imposed from without. In a country like Afghanistan, legitimacy does not come from the ballot box or international support alone; it requires internal consensus, coherence with the cultural and social context, transparency, and genuine participation of the people in decision-making. Governance is strengthened when formal state structures, local community values, and traditional institutions are connected; stability and legitimacy are undermined when this connection is ignored.|Yes! An important point that has been less addressed is the importance of institutional continuity in the process of state-building in Afghanistan. Experience has shown that extensive, accelerated, and person-centered changes in leadership, diplomacy, and government structures have caused no policy or program to survive. In the absence of continuity, capacities were not accumulated, historical memory was not formed, and each government effectively started from scratch. In my opinion, if policies and institutions had structural stability, a culture of accountability, and a program-centered approach, many domestic and international efforts in the path of state-building in Afghanistan would have had more lasting and effective results.\n",

    "ID_S1_012|10/26/2025 17:36:30|Former Afghan Government Official|2011–2015, 2016–2021|In my opinion, given Afghanistan's unique characteristics, not only over the past 20 years but also in the future, an effective leader can only be effective if, as a first step, they have a cross-ethnic vision for the country and consider Afghanistan to be connected to and dependent on all of its ethnic groups. Second, they must be specialized. To overcome and properly manage the crisis, they must assemble a team of experts to organize matters with complete competence, experience, and understanding. In short, a cross-ethnic vision and a specialized, experience-centered vision are essential characteristics of an effective leader in Afghanistan.|Afghan leaders managed to build relationships between official institutions and traditional structures to some extent, but this balance was unstable. For example, during the reigns of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, the Loya Jirga councils were used for national decision-making, but no sustainable coordination with government institutions was established.|Unfortunately, Afghanistan was completely dependent on aid from the international community, and this total dependence meant that, in times of crisis and decision-making, the country's leaders were unable to make independent decisions based on the national interests of the country. As a result, the outcome and repercussions of this situation were exactly what the United States wanted.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Widespread corruption|I disagree with the lack of financial resources.

It is a very detailed story that cannot be described here.|I think the biggest lesson that can be learned is that if a country like Afghanistan wants to emerge from the crisis, they must be careful in choosing and appointing their leaders, they must vote for people who will work for Afghanistan, and in the second step, the priority of the leaders and all the people should be the collective interests of the country. We voted based on ethnic affiliations, the leaders decided based on their ethnic affiliations, and the result was that the country became more critical. The big lesson is to appoint people based on their competence, honesty, and expertise, not ethnic affiliations, language, etc. In short, post-conflict countries need competent and honest people who prioritize the interests of the country above everything else.|While recalling the issues mentioned above, the most important issue that is vital for Afghanistan is governance away from emotions; over the past few decades, we have tried to turn the country into a battlefield and a conflict between neighbors with emotional policies. Afghanistan will not develop unless a neighbor called Pakistan feels at ease with us. Strategic wisdom dictates that we observe moderation in our relations between India and Pakistan to protect ourselves from possible harm from Pakistan, which we have unfortunately not done so far.\n",
    "ID_S1_013|10/26/2025 17:42:03|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|2011–2015|In my opinion, the two most important qualities for an effective Afghan leader after 2001 were: 1. The ability to build national unity: After years of war and ethnic conflict, an effective leader must be able to build trust and solidarity among different groups, ethnicities, and religions in order to lay the foundations for a sustainable nation-state. 2. Commitment to transparency and fighting corruption: During the reconstruction period in Afghanistan, rampant corruption was one of the main challenges. A leader who emphasizes transparency, accountability, and justice is able to maintain the trust of the people and the international community and make the development process sustainable.|Unfortunately, customs and traditions still prevail in many parts of the country, and tribal values are paramount. On the other hand, during the 20-year republic, some outsiders did not believe in these customs and traditions, and some even showed an excessive desire to use them to polish their image in front of the public by respecting customs and traditions. In my opinion, the result of these trends was a more critical situation in the country. We have multifaceted crises and problems in the country that must be solved with modern science, a specialized perspective, and effective diplomacy, or at least a reasonable solution must be found for them. However, not only did we lack a logical and specialized perspective in this area, but we also wanted to solve the country's most sensitive problems through the Loya Jirga, a council whose members are mostly illiterate or have limited education. In fact, the country's constitution stipulates that the constitution can be amended through the Loya Jirga, although it has its own procedures. In my opinion, after 2001, Afghan leaders were only able to build effective bridges between official state institutions and traditional structures, such as local councils and jirgas, to a limited extent. On the one hand, attempts were made to use traditional structures in decision-making. For example, the 2003 Constitutional Loya Jirga, the Consultative Peace Jirga, and the Jirga for the Release of Taliban Prisoners in subsequent years were examples of using local traditions to legitimize national decisions. These councils helped people feel that they had a stake in the political process. On the other hand, in many cases, a gap remained between the central government and local structures. The government failed to integrate these traditional institutions into the formal system in a sustainable manner. As a result, government decisions were sometimes met with opposition or mistrust at the local level. In short, attempts were made to build links, but these links were not sustainable or institutionalized, and one of the main weaknesses in the Afghan state-building process remained.|Overreliance on international financial and technical assistance has had profound effects on the development of independent strategic thinking among Afghan leaders. On the one hand, this reliance has led to the country's overall planning and decision-making being influenced by the priorities, policies, and interests of donor countries, rather than the real needs of Afghan society. As a result, many leaders focused on attracting foreign support to seize power and manage aid resources, rather than on developing sustainable national strategies. On the other hand, this situation has weakened the culture of domestic accountability; when budgets and resources are mainly provided from abroad, leaders feel less pressure to be accountable to the people. In other words, they derived their legitimacy more from international support than from public satisfaction. As a result, excessive reliance on foreign aid has hindered the growth of intellectual independence, institutional self-sufficiency, and political accountability among the Afghan leadership.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not very effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, rampant corruption, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|In addition to a lack of financial resources, one of the most notable internal weaknesses of Afghan state institutions was their lack of effective administrative and organizational capacities, coupled with rampant corruption.

Leaders and government officials have attempted to use this method to make decisions that address the country's best interests. However, in modern governance, non-traditional institutions that are not formed on the basis of a social contract do not have sufficient authority and credibility to make major decisions at the national level. Leaders or political elites in Afghanistan, who were in fact the traditional leaders of society, believed in this method as a solution to major national problems. Before the Taliban came to power, Afghan governments often turned to consultative jirga councils to resolve national issues and even make decisions affecting their foreign policy.

    "ID_S1_022|10/28/2025 5:49:47|International Diplomat/Representative of an International Organization|2016–2021|After 2001, an effective Afghan leader must possess two important qualities: First, his clear leadership encourages the establishment of true peace—a leader who stands with his countrymen amid the destruction that has befallen his country and builds bridges between all nations in the hope of reconciliation. Second, he must be honest and accountable to his people—a leader who stands with his people, leads them through their pain, grief, and hopes, and leads them with honesty.|He believes that Afghan leaders have many ways to build an effective relationship between formal government institutions and traditional communities and structures. Most of the time, both systems were in a state of distrust. The executive branch of the high command spent a lot of time on energy, which was important to him. On the other hand, traditional and tribal councils are crowded with government officials, have elders who do not trust them, and are rife with political corruption. In addition, traditional and local councils are more isolated from the armed forces and the opposition. Some political leaders have tried, but unfortunately, their symbolic efforts have been short-lived. In the case of the Loya Jirga, a local jirga was formed, the debate was managed, and everything was symbolic of his policies. Overall, this relationship remained incomplete—neither traditional structures, nor formal government institutions, nor the trust of the people were strengthened.|I believe that the country has relied too heavily on foreign political leaders and financial and technical assistance, which has weakened Afghan leaders' sense of national responsibility and independent strategic thinking. When equipment is the last important part of the organization, we can clearly see how weak mid-level government managers are, as well as their independence, strategic thinking, and responsibility. The sense of ownership of the country and the government has been seriously damaged, and the country has become heavily dependent on foreigners and their financial and technical assistance. After 2016, many leaders tried to reduce dependence on the homeland and restore responsibility. Remember some examples. For example, in 2016, Americans seriously discussed strengthening the country's air force. Similarly, we have only 157 Black Hawk helicopters. The air force has received dozens of transport and large military equipment, giant fighter jets, fighter jets, and bombers. Every six months, dozens of young people in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Europe, and the United States receive training in the Air Force. For example, when the former president seriously discussed the Case Management System (CMS), he took the matter to the US Supreme Court. In front of millions of American citizens, biometric data and its transfer were discussed, the nationality of topographic information was discussed, security responsibilities were transferred, and he also had a lot of work under his control, but he did his best, did not feel ownership, relied on foreign countries, and ultimately paved the way for the fall.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|I believe that the most serious impact is weak internal institutions, corruption, political interference, and weak capacity (capacity gap).

The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) launched the Afghan National Integration Program around 2003 with the help of the World Bank. This program aims to empower villagers to make decisions and develop and implement projects. De Biera's factors: 1. Social values of harmony: The Afghan Rural Council Program, the Jirga Council, and the Partnership should be established. The villagers chose the Shura Council (Village Development Council) and decided to implement the project (road, water, school, bridge, electricity, etc.). 2. Trust and sense of ownership among the people: When the people participated in decision-making, they felt that they were managing the project themselves, not the government or foreigners. Corruption became more difficult. 3. Gradual participation of women: In areas where traditional restrictions exist, the structure of women's councils should be introduced gradually and cautiously. Da Franji prevented conflict and paved the way for Kibledo. The result: more than 35,000 projects benefited from the National Solidarity Program, and thousands of small development projects improved people's lives. The Community Development Program of the World Bank and other institutions is a successful example.

This leader must have strategic leadership and the ability to make decisive decisions in order to pursue a clear strategy for the country's stability, security, and long-term economic growth. A close relationship with the people and a deep understanding of the nation's needs and values are also essential for a leader, as the trust of the people is the foundation of any legitimate system. In addition, the leader of international relations must have the ability to manage effectively, so that the national interests of Afghanistan and its international partners are protected in a balanced manner.|After 2001, the Afghan government leadership faced political and administrative complexities in achieving an effective balance between formal institutions and traditional community structures, namely jirgas and local councils. The political and social reality in Afghanistan shows that traditional structures of legitimacy, arbitration, and social order are based on historical provisions, while formal government institutions represent modern governance, accountability, and the rule of law. Although some leaders have attempted to integrate the two by establishing consultative councils, these efforts have often failed to achieve effective coordination and long-term action. For example, the adoption of the Loya Jirga constitution and the participation of the people is a symbolic example, and the decision itself has not been fully implemented at the political or administrative level of the Loya government. Overall, the efforts of Afghan leaders and formal and informal institutions to build an effective bridge have been limited because they do not appreciate traditions and structures. This should be recognized as an authentic form, not only in modern state-building, but also in line with the principles of a sustainable framework.|His analysis, leadership of Afghanistan, international financial and technical assistance, and heavy reliance on independent strategic thinking and responsiveness had a profound impact on the institution. This dependence has often forced leaders to follow the requirements and conditions of international donors, limiting their ability to make independent, long-term policy decisions. It will also weaken the culture of accountability, because decisions about responsibility and accountability will, in most cases, depend on foreign institutions and their expectations. In addition, reliance on foreign aid has also limited local innovation, capacity building, and national resources based on decision-making capacity, damaging the government's legitimacy and public confidence.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|In addition to limited financial resources, limited human and administrative capacity in Afghan government institutions is one of the biggest internal obstacles that has had a profound impact on service delivery and policy implementation.

In addition, deficiencies in internal organizational structures, centralized decision-making, high centralization, lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms, and weak inter-agency coordination have prevented the effective implementation of policies.

In addition, local leaders, communities, and cultural sensitivities take into account the lack of diplomatic efforts and international cooperation and influence.

    "ID_S2_004|Former Afghan Government Official|During the years 2011-2021, President Ashraf Ghani made a clear decision to support the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Gas Pipeline Project (TAPI Pipeline Project). At that time, Afghanistan was facing serious economic problems, such as energy shortages and restrictions on regional trade. Ashraf Ghani emphasized the priority of national interests and considered the overall interests of the country to be superior to ethnic or regional interests. He actively participated in international negotiations, signed relevant agreements, and approved the necessary internal measures for pipeline construction, such as land use and route selection. Although the project is not yet complete, Ghani's decision has paved the way for the expansion of regional economic cooperation and the creation of job opportunities for the people of Afghanistan, and has given the country international economic credibility. This is an example where national interests took precedence over ethnic interests and had positive outcomes.|Direct experience from a road construction project in Parwan province in 2017 showed how administrative and financial corruption hinders coordination. During the implementation of the contracts for this project, some contracting companies did not properly adhere to road construction standards, and in some sections, only a thin layer of sand was used. According to reports from local people and the press, the project delays and poor road quality were linked to corruption, as contracts were often awarded in the names of influential individuals. As a result, not only was the road quality poor, but coordination between government agencies and international partners was also slow, and service delivery to local people was affected. This example illustrates how corruption can have a serious negative impact on project implementation, service quality, and the coordination system.|A long-standing water distribution problem in Laghman province of Afghanistan has worsened due to poor cooperation between official institutions and local leaders. The provincial Department of Agriculture tried to start the construction project of a canal, but a place for consultation with the local jirgas and councils was not selected.

The government agencies relied solely on administrative orders, without providing opportunities for trust and participation to local leaders. The outcome was that the project was delayed, water distribution conflicts increased, and public dissatisfaction grew. This example illustrates that coordination between formal and traditional structures plays a vital role in resolving local conflicts.|The police building program in Afghanistan is an example where foreign aid had a negative impact against national interests. A lot of money was spent by international donors to fund and equip the police, but not enough attention was given to managing and building the capacity of the Afghan government's security sector. This process weakened the Afghan government's sovereignty and was driven solely by foreign priorities, not based on Afghanistan's long-term security needs. As a result, there was an increase in police corruption and a weakening of the government system, which had consequences against national interests.|A practical recommendation for Afghanistan's reconstruction is that the international community should implement each aid project thru Afghanistan's national budget and national institutions, rather than having different projects managed by separate donors. This not only prevents the waste of resources but also helps strengthen the country's governmental capacities. A joint fund should be established for aid, with financial oversight and management thru the Ministry of Finance, and project monitoring given to representatives of the community and government. Project implementation should be based on the consultation and participation of local people to ensure their needs are met correctly and to increase project effectiveness. To this end, the transparency of all projects and the monitoring of results should be done thru financial and non-financial audits.

    "ID_S2_009|International Diplomat/Representative of an International Organization|Regarding the transnational leader: In 2020, I was working at the Ministry of Water and Energy as the Director of Water Affairs Regulation for the General Directorate of the Kabul River Basin. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, initiated a move to divide the Ministry of Water and Energy into two agencies: the National Water Affairs Regulatory Authority and the National Energy Affairs Regulatory Authority. From an administrative perspective, this was a positive and national act because Afghanistan produces approximately 75 billion cubic meters of water annually but is unable to utilize 20% of this total due to mismanagement. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a single agency for comprehensive management of water resources to control Afghanistan's water resources thru a strategic plan spanning approximately 5 years and 10 years. Part A: This was a positive step toward economic growth for the country, improving agriculture from the water infrastructure. Part B: This action by the president failed because the president had ethnic and personal motives for two reasons. First, he turned the ministry into an administration because he wanted to be allowed by the constitution to appoint anyone to head an administration without needing a vote from parliament to elect them. Secondly, according to the agreements of the unity government, the Ministry of Water and Energy belonged to Dr. Abdullah. How could he have his close associates in this ministry when he had turned the ministry into a management?|Corruption as an obstacle to coordination, there were two reasons for the president to carry out widespread corruption. First, he appointed someone close to him to head the administration, and thru this, he was able to implement the infrastructure projects for the imaginary water facilities and add their cost to his capital, which he almost did. Or, he contracted and implemented the infrastructure projects for the water facilities with several companies that were from his own people, and he did. I witnessed several projects; a small example of this was the maintenance and care of the Darunta Dam, which cost approximately 53 million Afghanis. This project was contracted by a company from his own people, and it can be said that this project was contracted for 25 million. Secondly, according to the law, the head of the administration was appointed by the president, and this head of the administration was accountable and reported to no one other than the president. Even Parliament, the embodiment of the people's will, did not have the authority to remove or hold them accountable.|Regarding the gap between the formal and dominant institutions, I must say that since the ministries and departments were restructured, the president, according to the constitution, had the authority to choose the head of the department himself. Parliament, which represented the people, had no vote or authority in this process. For this reason, a person close to power or with political influence was usually appointed to head the departments, rather than technical and expert individuals. The person who was appointed only reported to the president and was not accountable to any other institution. For example, in the Surkh Rod district of Nangarhar province (the Sultanpur area), a project to build a protective wall was implemented. I don't remember the exact cost, but it was very high. This project was approved thru the Ministry of Energy and Water at the time. The wall was supposed to be two and a half meters high below ground, hidden from public view, but it was only built to a height of about one and a half meters; another meter remained incomplete, and unsuitable materials were used. When the flood came, the wall collapsed and caused extensive damage to people's land. People complained, but because the head of the department and his close associates were involved at the top of the project, no one dared to follow up. The implementing company was also owned by the head of the department himself and was mostly selected based on ethnic ties. At that time, such disputes were unsolvable because when the project is the government itself and the government's power is behind it, the people have no way to resist. As a result, the problem remained unresolved and no authority had the jurisdiction to investigate.|At the National Water Resources Management Authority where I worked, foreign aid played a very effective role. No independent decisions were made; most projects were funded thru the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and the implementation of the projects depended on these resources. When the Ministry of Energy and Water was transformed into the National Water Regulatory Authority, a new problem arose: the authority was no longer accountable to parliament because its head was appointed by the president and only reported to him. There was no regulatory authority (except for the president himself). For this reason, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank stopped their aid. They said, \"We will not give money to an office that is not accountable and cannot be questioned.\" While the minister was approved by parliament and accountable to the people when the ministry existed. However, the administration lacked such legitimacy, which is why many of the projects that were in the plan were not implemented and remained unfinished.|Based on my experience with the reconstruction situation in Afghanistan, if the international community wants to intervene in post-war countries, it should provide aid thru non-governmental and international organizations (NGOs), not directly thru the government. Because when aid is channeled thru the government, there is usually nepotism, ethnic discrimination, and widespread corruption. The minister gives orders to his close associates, they pass them on to their employes, and the result is that the budget doesn't reach the real people. But in the international model: • A donor entity provides the funds, and a specific institution implements the project. • The second body independently (directly or indirectly) monitors whether the aid has reached the intended recipients. • Separate oversight reduces corruption and increases transparency. For this reason, if aid is provided thru international organizations and strong monitoring teams are in place, no one can act against global standards and people will benefit more from the results.\n",

And this incident caused the project to be delayed.|from 2014 to 2017, the Ministry of Public Health, under the leadership of Ferozuddin Feroz and with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), had a program to build rural clinics in the eastern part of the country. However, in Nangarhar province, administrative corruption at the level of the Public Health Directorate and local contractors led to contracts being awarded to affiliated companies and the work being carried out poorly. Many clinics remained unfinished, and the WHO temporarily suspended funding for the project. Administrative corruption hindered people's access to healthcare services and reduced the confidence of donors.|In 2018, the government initiated the Jaghori Dam project in Ghazni province without consulting the people of Andar district. People protested because they said the watercourse passed thru their land and their rights were being ignored. Because government officials did not cooperate with local elders and guilds, tensions escalated and the project was halted for several months. The lack of cooperation between the government and traditional structures caused delays in the project and led to public distrust.|From 2017 to 2020, several development projects in road construction and water supply were implemented in Daikundi province by USAID and UNOPS. Foreign donors themselves determined the routes, companies, and even the type of building materials, without sufficient coordination with the local administration or the people. Local officials suggested the road route pass thru more populated areas so more people could benefit, but because the final decision was made at the Kabul headquarters with the input of foreign consultants, the less beneficial route was chosen. The project was implemented at a high cost but with less benefit.|Afghanistan's experience shows that when decisions are made without consulting the people, transparency, and a national perspective, the outcome is usually failure; whether in ethnic decisions, government and administrative discussions, or projects implemented under foreign influence. Therefore, in any future international intervention, the aid framework should revolve around a few principles: first, national ownership – decisions should be made domestically, with the leadership of the government and local people, not in foreign offices, and not with the ethnic bias of past governments. Second, accountability and transparency – all projects must be implemented thru the national budget to enable monitoring and accountability. Third, public consultation – local councils and community elders should be involved in project design and monitoring from the outset to prevent ethnic and social conflicts. And in the financial resources section, there needs to be very close monitoring and auditing to prevent financial corruption.\n",
    "ID_S2_011|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|About transnational leadership during the National Unity Government or the Republic from 2014-2020 is that the appointment of governors and heads of departments in Ghor was often based on ethnic affiliation and political pressure, not on merit. In several cases, individuals close to specific ethnic factions were appointed to head local departments such as Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Education, and Health. The result was increased ethnic competition between Tajiks, Hazaras, and Pashtuns within the administration, reduced coordination between institutions, many development projects remained unfinished, people lost trust in the administration, and social divisions widened.|Corruption as an obstacle to the coordination of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development's development projects, especially water supply and road construction projects in the province's districts. Contract companies were selected thru the mediation of some local officials, and a large portion of the project budget was embezzled. Some projects were never completed at all, or their quality was very low. As a result, donors like USAID and UNDP halted a portion of the funding, and project implementation was delayed for several years. Local people lost trust in government institutions.|The gap between the formal and traditional institutions of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, which implemented an irrigation project without consulting local jirgas. Because the stream's path passed thru land belonging to another village and their consent had not been obtained, the conflict between the two villages escalated and the project was halted. Several months later, negotiations were resumed with the mediation of tribal elders, but government institutions had already lost their credibility.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic governance in adapting aid projects, particularly in the health and education sectors, which were funded by foreign entities such as USAID and the World Bank. Decision-making regarding priorities and budget was primarily done in Kabul and by foreign entities, without considering the actual needs of the people. Health centers were built in a few districts of the province, but permanent human resources and budget were not provided for them. The projects were seemingly completed but closed down after a few months. This dependence on external decisions made the local government feel powerless to manage independently.|Practical recommendations for the future based on my personal experiences. Aid should be managed and monitored thru local councils, namely Jirgas and Development Councils, not just from Kabul or foreign institutions. Local people should have a direct role in all stages, from planning to consumption. The reason is that in projects where the people of Ghor were involved in decision-making, such as some national solidarity and citizenship programs, there was less corruption and the work was actually completed. However, in projects where decisions were made in Kabul or by foreigners, more funds were wasted and there was no accountability.\n",

Mr. Fazli had studied nursing and did not have the understanding and knowledge of a large and important structure like the Presidential Affairs Department. Their selection was based on ethnicity and proximity to Ghani.|Aid and funding organizations for Afghan projects have always complained about corruption within the structures and were well aware of its widespread presence. The majority of Afghanistan's development projects were supported by the international community and implemented by state-owned companies, which were not executed properly due to wasted project budgets, leading to low project quality. For example, the Kabul-Kandahar road was built with low-quality materials and was very inefficient, deteriorating sooner than the standard they had set.|Ghani had a dual perspective. In its own ethnic structure, there was no problem with local councils. The Jirga somehow saw itself as the guarantor of power's firmness, but the ethnic, local organizations and ethnic Jirgas of other ethnic groups were seen as a threat to its power, and it said, \"We can no longer tolerate the 'island of power'.\" The reason for Ghani's conflict with other ethnic groups caused people not to support Ghani's government and further widened the gap between the government and the nation.

B) was influenced by ethnic bias and resulted in failure.

    "ID_S2_016|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|During the rule of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan under Presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, senior officials served who prioritized national interests over ethnic, partisan, and religious interests. A prime example of this could be the extension of the security agreement between the Afghan government and NATO, which resulted in national security and national interests being guarantyd for a specific period. In contrast, a limited number of party leaders working within the government structure prioritized ethnic interests over national interests, and their ethnic policies widened divisions among the people, ultimately undermining national unity. Political parties active in Afghanistan were operating with an expanding ethnic agenda to attract supporters and win elections. Parties should not have considered ethnic, regional, linguistic, religious, or other factors that harm national interests and unity as criteria for their activities. As a result, division among the people increased and hopes for a bright future diminished. Afghanistan's credibility with the international community diminished and international aid was limited. Because most of these aids were misused by these individuals, and the path to Afghanistan's growth and development was challenged.|One sector that did not yield positive results due to widespread administrative corruption was Afghanistan's education sector. Due to the existence of ghost schools and teachers, most of the government's money and budget was embezzled by ministers and senior officials. Cases of administrative corruption in Afghan courts speak to the widespread corruption and lack of transparency. International aid, without effective accountability from ministry leaders, led to delays in the delivery of international assistance and a decline in the quality of education in the country.|International aid provided to Afghanistan should have been implemented in full coordination with the local people thru beneficial projects. Most areas of Afghanistan lack access to safe water, and projects implemented by international NGOs like DACAAR to improve access to safe water often faced implementation difficulties due to local conflicts. Every village or location wanted to implement these projects in their areas, but due to budget constraints, it was difficult for the aid received to reach all vulnerable areas. In many cases, local people prevented the implementation of foreign projects due to security concerns and the activities of armed opponents in their areas. In some cases, these issues were resolved in coordination with local CDC councils, and the local people provided specific conditions to allow these projects to be adapted. For example, the water supply project in Badakhshan and Kunar provinces, which were insecure and had limited access to the government, was implemented with the advice and coordination of local councils because these were humanitarian aid and did not pursue political goals, so the local people allowed the implementation. In conflict-ridden areas, there are widespread disputes over water sources, including the legal ownership of these water resources, which is contested by local people. This has caused project implementation to be delayed or halted.|On the one hand, foreign aid played a very important and vital role for the Afghan government and people in the post-civil war period. However, most of this aid was implemented without oversight and at the discretion of the donor countries, and the Afghan people were unaware of the amount of this aid and how it was spent. Civil activists have mostly expressed their concern that the lack of transparency in the use of domestic budgets and international aid undermines the effectiveness of these contributions. In some cases, donor countries often prioritized their national interests over foreign aid. For example, the aid provided by the Iranian government to the office of Hamid Karzai's government was due to American political and military competition, and they demanded their interests in return for this aid from the Afghan government. The aid that the Indian government continued to provide for the development of Afghanistan was aimed at weakening Pakistan's regional role in the Afghan issue. These factors, which exacerbated regional conflict and competition with neighboring countries, ultimately had a significant impact on national interests and security.|The main recommendation for improving international aid delivery by the global community is to provide transparent mechanisms for implementing these projects so that accountability for these projects is clear to the people. This aid should be under the direct supervision of the people, and the basic priorities of the people should be considered in the preparation of development plans. Afghanistan is in dire need of international aid. Afghanistan is not a poor country and is not in dire need of international aid. The government cannot handle this humanitarian crisis alone, and the international community must continue its assistance. Foreign aid provided by international aid organizations did not reduce poverty in the country due to a lack of transparency, and public distrust of this aid increased. Afghanistan is still an economically weak country, and according to international statistics, Afghanistan faces a harsh winter, making a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan still possible. In order for foreign institutional aid to be effectively implemented in the country, an effective accountability mechanism must be established in coordination with the government, civil society, and people's representatives so that this aid can be effectively implemented and Afghanistan can potentially achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n",

If we assume this statement is correct and disregard the existence of a concept called \"leader\" in Afghanistan, and consider an action that transcends one's nationality, we can cite the recognition of education by private institutions in the country as an effective measure. This decision was made and implemented by President Karzai and, in my opinion, is considered one of the lasting and historic actions for the country.| Very clearly and openly, Afghanistan is considered one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This incorrect historical pattern has a history dating back to the country's contemporary era, but it reached its peak during the decade of democracy. It's very difficult to provide an example of corruption! You might think that if there was so much widespread corruption, why would it be difficult to find such an example? The answer is that in all government projects, corruption was considered part of the job and was so institutionalized that no work could be considered exempt from corruption. Therefore, I mention the Ministry of Public Health's health project as an example. In the implementation of this important project, corruption was rampant and multi-faceted, which both delayed the project's completion and led to the ineffective use of international community aid.|One of the fundamental problems in Afghanistan is the conflict between tradition and modernity. This conflict manifests itself in various forms, sometimes as the government versus traditional society, and at other times in other forms such as modern education and schools, and so on. A large portion of unfinished projects and actions have been due to this conflict. If you look at the annual budget codes, you'll notice that a large portion of the allocated budgets hasn't been used. When you investigate the reason, you'll find that the local people have prevented the project from being implemented, saying it doesn't align with our traditions and customs. Specifically, I can mention the non-implementation of school construction projects in Khost and Logar provinces.|The Geneva meetings and the setting of 21 indicators by donors directly subordinated Afghanistan's policymaking and budget to foreign priorities. Instead of genuine reform, the government manipulated figures and engaged in a superficial fight against corruption to maintain the flow of aid. This process eliminated independent decision-making, institutionalized financial dependence, and sacrificed national interests for the sake of continued foreign aid.|Aid should be spent 100% thru the national budget and under local community oversight, rather than directly injecting currency and creating dependency, and the focus should be on strengthening domestic capacities.

For example, in the education sector in every province of Afghanistan, and similarly in every school at the provincial level, there were dozens and hundreds of fictitious teachers (there were no teachers at all). The name of the teacher was all that existed. Money and national budgets were embezzled by individuals at the leadership and management levels of the education sector.

These lands do not have official municipal documents, only customary ones. The government declared them public, and people began construction in this area. The municipality and land administration did not allow people to build here, but people started construction by paying money or using their connections with members of parliament or high-ranking officials of official institutions. However, this institution was unable or unwilling to solve the people's problems at their root, and now, with nearly a thousand homes built, they still lack municipal deeds and maps, and the government considers this land its own. Now the government is in trouble. If it demolishes all these houses, it will cost the government a lot of money, and the people will also be in a state of uncertainty and confusion. This indicates gaps in formal and legal institutions.|In Afghanistan, the president was appointed by the United States of America in consultation with the European Union.

However, the voter turnout was really low; the election site staff were just hoping someone would come and cast their vote.|If the international community wants to intervene in a post-conflict country, I have a few recommendations: 1) It must create strong, impartial infrastructure that is in line with the country's culture (such as transparent laws, the rule of law, impartial and accountable election monitoring bodies). 2) If other international organizations provide financial and humanitarian aid, instead of distributing it directly to the people, they should create employment opportunities, for example, by assisting and reviving sectors such as agriculture, handicrafts, and tourism, so that people can become self-sufficient and overcome their problems. 3) Establishing independent, impartial, and accountable media outlets for the people. 4) Establishing democratic institutions where the people themselves can choose their own destiny and their own leader. 5) Local people should have a role in how aid is distributed or consumed. 6) Instead of being consumptive, the focus on how aid is used should be developmental and infrastructural. 7) Instead of being distributed thru NGOs, aid should be created in the form of an agricultural bank or reconstruction. For example, it wants to provide low-interest loans to individuals in the agricultural sector or other businesses. If these individuals are successful, they will be given more loans or their interest will be waived so that people are encouraged to solve their own problems instead of always relying on aid.\n",
    "ID_S2_020|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|President Hamid Karzai's 2013 decision to jointly recruit young people from different ethnic groups to expand the national army is an example where national interests were prioritized over ethnic interests, resulting in a relatively positive outcome. Conversely, the decisions of some politicians during the 2019-2020 elections, which were based on ethnic biases, led to unsuccessful outcomes. a) National interests take precedence over ethnic interests - positive example • Background: From 2011 to 2014, the security situation in Afghanistan was poor and the withdrawal of international forces had been announced. It was necessary for the army and national police to be able to defend the entire country. • Action: Hamid Karzai announced a program to expand the national army, under which young people from different ethnic groups were recruited jointly. The recruitment process was intentionally designed to represent all of Afghanistan instead of a specific ethnic group. • Result: A relative balance was created in the camp's structure, which strengthened the sense of national identity and increased its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. Although problems remained, this decision reflected a transnational vision. b) Decision based on ethnic preferences – a failed example • Background: In the 2019-2020 elections, there was intense competition among political groups. Some high-ranking officials were making decisions to appease their ethnic supporters. • Action: Some politicians, whose support was based on ethnicity, opposed the election results and declared a parallel government. Instead of supporting transparent trends and national unity, decisions became subject to ethnic preferences. • Result: A legitimacy crisis was created, public trust in the government decreased, and the ground was prepared for the Taliban to regroup. This is a clear example of the negative consequences of a lack of national vision.|The Kabul Bank case – a clear example of corruption • Background: Kabul Bank was the largest private bank in Afghanistan and was used to pay salaries and finance development projects. International aid and government financial programs were primarily channeled thru this bank. • Action: Between 2010 and 2013, senior bank officials and individuals close to the government illegally withdrew approximately billion for personal gain. This corruption occurred thru fake loans, personal expenses, and funding political networks. • Result: Projects were halted: Educational and health projects whose salaries and budgets were paid thru Kabul Bank were delayed for several months. The quality of services decreased: Teachers and doctors were unable to continue working due to not receiving their salaries, and the quality of educational and health services declined. Cutting off foreign aid: International partners, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF), suspended aid programs to Afghanistan until the government takes serious action against corruption. By October 2012, only a small portion of the stolen money had been recovered, severely damaging global trust. Consonance obstacle (harmony) • This case showed that corruption is not just a domestic problem, but also erodes the trust of international partners. • The cessation and cutting of aid destroyed the atmosphere of cooperation between the government and the world and became a major obstacle to development projects. Result: The Kabul Bank scandal is a clear answer to this question: corruption causes project delays, reduces service quality, and cuts off foreign aid. This experience proves that the lack of transparency and accountability is the biggest obstacle to coordinating development programs.|The gap between formal and traditional institutions • Province: Helmand • Problem: Conflict over water resources (Helmand River water division) Explanation :In Helmand province, the water distribution problem worsened due to poor cooperation between government agencies and traditional local councils. • Background: The Helmand River's seawater is of vital importance for agriculture. There was no coordination between the government's official programs and the traditional decisions of the local elders. • Result: Water disputes increased, some areas faced water scarcity, and agricultural production decreased. The lack of joint decision-making between formal and traditional institutions hindered problem-solving. Positive control sample • Province: Nangarhar • Problem: Property dispute • Result: Due to effective cooperation between the state court and the local jirga, the land dispute was resolved jointly and both parties accepted the decision. Result: These examples show that when there is no cooperation (like in Helmand), conflicts are prolonged. But when cooperation is effective (like in Nangarhar), the problem is solved relatively successfully.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic autonomy . Example: The 2013-2015 security strategy, which was based on US and NATO assistance. Background • Due to the withdrawal of international forces (2014), the Afghan government was forced to design a large part of its security strategy and budget based on US and NATO aid. • The priority of global war contributors with the Taliban was to help and maintain major cities, not to create widespread local stability. Action • The focus of the national security strategy was placed on cities and highways, as requested by global partners. • Security funding was reduced for remote areas because donors controlled resource allocation according to their own priorities. Negative consequences • Contrary to national interests: The government's need was to secure the villages, but due to external pressure, security was only concentrated in the cities. • Result: The Taliban's influence in remote areas increased. The government's legitimacy decreased. Instead of long-term stability, a short-term defensive strategy was formed that was at odds with national interests. Result: This example shows that when national policy is subject to the priorities of foreign donors, the government's strategic independence is weakened, and the outcome is detrimental to national interests.|Practical advice for the future. Recommendation: Aid should be spent thru the \"national single budget,\" but under the transparent oversight of local people and with independent accountability mechanisms. How to make it practical • 1. National Unified Budget Framework: All global aid must be spent thru the official government budget, not thru separate donor projects. This prevents the creation of parallel offices and ensures coordination with national programs. • 2. Local Monitoring: At the provincial and district levels, people's councils or civil society organizations should monitor the implementation of projects. This reduces corruption and increases public trust. • 3. Independent Accounting: A common accounting system should be established for the use of aid, involving the government, global donors, and civil society. Reasons based on failures • During the reconstruction of Afghanistan, much of the aid was spent outside the government budget, resulting in: or creating parallel offices, or weakening the government's legitimacy, the increase in corruption, and the loss of public trust. Reasons based on successes • Projects implemented thru national budgets and under public supervision (such as some rural development projects) were relatively successful because people considered them \"their own projects.\" Result: To succeed in war-torn countries, aid must be channeled solely thru the national budget and be spent under public oversight and an independent accounting system. This framework prevents corruption, strengthens government legitimacy, and increases public trust.\n",

That's why we can't choose our own initiative and a correct perspective. For example, US aid and equipment for the training and education of the national army, which was entirely dependent on them, did not benefit the people much, and ultimately, the forces they deployed, Units 01 and 02, were deployed by them based on strategic decisions and plans that the government had not prepared or trained for, and ultimately, the US government took them with them. He took them with him, calling them his created and trained forces, not because they were being used effectively in Afghanistan's security affairs.|Afghanistan should have a thorough situation analysis based on impartial monitoring and surveys. Based on the analysis results and the situation, aid should be pledged to Afghanistan and transferred to Afghanistan thru Afghanistan's own national budget, and the use of this budget in Afghanistan should be monitored to prevent corruption in its expenditure. In other words, the institution or donor that is cooperating, or the international community itself, should closely monitor how its cooperation is being used. This is how monetary and financial corruption is prevented and a positive change is brought about in the work process.|\n",
    "ID_S2_022|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|A clear example of both states can be found during the Republic era (2011-2021). For example, we can recall Ashraf Ghani's decision to sign a security agreement with the United States, which he stated aimed to prioritize national interests over ethnic interests. Karzai refused to sign the treaty, but Hanif Atmar, the then foreign minister, signed the treaty on behalf of Ashraf Ghani in 2014. After the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the debate over signing a \"Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA)\" with the United States was heated. Hamid Karzai refused to sign it, considering it contrary to national independence. However, at the beginning of the National Unity Government, despite political pressure from various ethnic factions, Ashraf Ghani decided to sign it. Ashraf Ghani stated that the purpose of this action was to ensure the survival of the government structure and security forces, maintain financial aid, and prevent a security vacuum. Many Pashtun-centric figures within the government and Karzai's circle opposed it by signing, but Ghani called it a \"national necessity.\" After signing this agreement, Western financial and military support for the Afghan government continued until 2021, and the Nano mission to assist and equip the national army continued. The signing of this treaty strengthened the international legitimacy of the Afghan government. Although this decision sparked criticism, it was a rare example of prioritizing national interests (in line with the survival of the republican system and the country's security) despite ethnic and political pressures, and it had positive short-term results. It is worth mentioning that Rahmatullah Nabil (former head of national security) also opposed political and ethnic pressures multiple times during his tenure as head of national security (2014-2016) and emphasized strengthening national and non-ethnic structures within the intelligence services. His opposition to the release of some Taliban figures, particularly due to political and ethnic pressures, was a sign of prioritizing national interests over ethnic interests. Nabil's resignation in protest against Ashraf Ghani's personal and discriminatory policies (during his visit to Pakistan) was a sign of his nationalist stance. b) Ethnically biased and exclusionary decisions (2017-2020). During Ashraf Ghani's second term as president, appointments in security institutions – particularly the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the National Directorate of Security – took on a distinctly ethnic flavor. Many commanders and governors were appointed based on the criterion of \"ethnic loyalty,\" regardless of their professional and technical competence. for example, in 2018, Ashraf Ghani appointed General Tariq Shah Bahrami (affiliated with a specific ethnic circle) as Minister of Defense instead of Abdullah Habibi. These changes, along with the gradual removal of Tajik and Uzbek commanders from security structures, sparked strong political reactions in the north of the country. This displacement weakened cohesion within the security forces and widened the gap between the northern forces and the central government. These decisions also undermined trust within the resistance fronts against the Taliban, ultimately leading to the rapid fall of provinces in 2021 as a result of the collapse of the chain of command and lack of coordination among the forces. This type of ethnocentric decision-making was an example of ethnic interests overriding national interests, which led to the weakening of the security structure and the collapse of the republican system. At the end of his second term, instead of strengthening national institutions, Hamid Karzai (President until 2014) strengthened a network of ethnic and local commanders to maintain his ethnic influence in the south of the country. In appointing governors and security officials, he prioritized ethnic balance over merit, and instead of strengthening \"nation-building,\" he pursued a policy of \"ethnic appeasement\" to ensure his political survival. These decisions of his had bad consequences and It rooted the culture of ethnic dealing in the government structure and passed it on to the next government. It then became clear that these Karzai programs were steps toward paving the way for the Taliban, until Ghani completed Karzai's unfinished mission by handing over the Arg to the Taliban. Amrullah Saleh (Ashraf Ghani's first deputy and former national security chief), despite his anti-terrorism and nationalist record, spoke from an ethnic perspective in the final years of his cooperation with Ghani, contributing to the polarization of the political atmosphere. Also, some of his statements and positions on social media, instead of emphasizing \"national convergence,\" sometimes took on an ethnic and linguistic tone. Such positions reduced the capacity for national unity within the anti-Taliban resistance front in the final days of the Republic.|No response|A clear example of this type of project can be explained in Nangarhar province, where the dispute was over water distribution in the Serekan (Spin Ghar) district. Between 2016 and 2019, the dispute between the farmers of two villages over the distribution of water from the \"Kameh\" irrigation canal intensified due to a lack of coordination between the Nangarhar Water Basin Department and local councils. Because the government had changed the canal route without consulting local influentials, local conflicts erupted and agricultural lands remained dry for several months. In contrast, a project in Bamyan province can be mentioned where the dispute over the boundary of agricultural lands in the village of \"Shiber\" (2018-2019) was resolved thru dialog. In this case, close cooperation between the Bamyan Department of Agriculture and local elders led to the establishment of a mediation committee, resolving the dispute peacefully thru dialog.|A specific example of this project was the decision-making process regarding the implementation of the \"TAPI\" project (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline) around the years 2015-2021, with the Asian Development Bank and the government of Turkmenistan as donors. Explanation: The Afghan government, under pressure and encouragement from foreign donors, especially the Asian Development Bank, prioritized the advancement of the TAPI project to be recognized as a regionally supported energy transit route. However, in practice, insecurity along the project route and the lack of guarantyd real benefits for the people of Afghanistan led to national investment in domestic energy infrastructure (such as electricity generation from northern gas or domestic dams) being overlooked. The failure of this project to materialize had negative consequences. This project never materialized, diverting government attention from more urgent domestic projects, increasing Afghanistan's political dependence on regional countries; as a result, Afghanistan's national interests were sacrificed to the geopolitical priorities of the donors.|Aid should be 100% channeled thru the government's national budget and monitored by the local people, not thru separate donor projects. Practical advice: In any post-war reconstruction program, before allocating funds and starting projects, a \"tripartite partnership structure\" must be established between the central government, local institutions, and civil society to ensure joint decision-making on priorities and monitoring of implementation. One successful example of this project was the Citizen Covenant program. In the \"Citizenship Covenant\" program (2016-2020), when village development councils participated in decision-making about small projects (such as roads or schools), the projects were implemented on time and with quality. However, in projects that were planned solely by ministries or foreign donors (such as some World Bank projects in the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development), work either stopped or the quality decreased due to local distrust and administrative corruption. This poor quality of projects will be resolved when they have genuine participation. This showed that without the genuine participation of the people and local leaders in design and monitoring, no foreign aid, even if it amounts to billions of dollars, will be sustainable or used effectively.\n",
    "ID_S2_023|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|Multinational countries and diverse societies need leaders who have a national and transnational vision to facilitate peaceful coexistence among all ethnic groups and various socio-political groups in light of the country/society's prevailing laws. My visit, along with that of former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, with the perspective of prioritizing ethnic interests, paved the way in 2021 for the downfall of a legitimate, inclusive government in favor of a specific ethnic group (the Taliban), both of whom are from the same ethnic background (Pashtun). He removed experienced and influential individuals from the ranks of the security forces and civil positions, gradually handed over districts to the Taliban one after another, and finally brought an end to the 20-year Republic with his own escape.|Many international partners were involved in the corruption of high-ranking Afghan officials, and in many cases, they prevented their prosecution by judicial and legal institutions. In my opinion, the hypothesis that widespread corruption was the main obstacle to cooperation between the government and international partners is incorrect. On the contrary, high-ranking government officials and most of their international partners were complicit in widespread corruption, including the law, police, judiciary, prosecution, parliament, and the military. Everything was under the control of this corrupt gang; there was no second authority to hold them accountable, and everyone was in cahoots. I have personally seen dozens of infrastructure projects that, despite consuming huge sums of money, have not lasted due to poor quality and are currently unusable.|One of the main reasons for the lack of institutionalization of laws in Afghanistan's various systems has been these traditional tribal structures, and in many cases, despite the clarity of the law, disputes were resolved by local elders, which often resulted in injustice in the decisions of local councils and tribal elders' assemblies. Traditional and tribal structures have never been supportive of the rule of law in the country; on the contrary, these structures have weakened the law.|Exactly, governments dependent on foreign aid are not independent in their decision-making. For example: The extraction of the Aynak copper mine in Logar province was awarded by the then government to a Chinese company, but due to the disagreements and conflicts between China and Western countries, led by the United States, and because the Chinese company was also the financial backer of the then government, the extraction of this national project was not allowed to be realized, and the government was obliged to follow the policies and guidelines of the United States.|Not all countries are in the same state after a war; some may need to rebuild buildings, roads, bridges, and highways. However, some of these countries may have a serious need and priority for education, promoting the rule of law, strengthening national unity, raising citizens' knowledge levels, avoiding violence, and so on. Okay. In any case, international aid should be distributed and used thru the government institutions of the war-torn country with international supervision.\n",

However, with the intervention of a politician who sought to profit from the project, the project was never implemented.|Province: Balkh :Type of problem: Water resource conflict (agricultural irrigation)In 2019, a dispute arose in Chamtal district of Balkh province between the two villages of Chashma Shirin and Aq Kupruk over the distribution of water from the Balkhab River. The Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Directorate, without consulting the village council and local elders, decided to change the water distribution route in the secondary canal to help the new irrigation project. Local leaders and the local council considered this decision unilateral and contrary to the previous agreement, and prevented its implementation. The government was also unable to implement the decision without local support. Result : The channel remained closed for about two months. Agricultural lands in both villages were dry and damaged. Physical and armed clashes occurred between young people from two villages, and several people were injured. The issue was only temporarily resolved after a joint council was formed between the government and local elders.|It is clear that non-discretionary budgets (foreign aid) have a negative impact on the independent decision-making of government institutions. A specific answer will be provided below. Decision Topic: Increasing the size of security forces beyond the country's financial capacity Time: 2011-2014. Effective Donor: United States and NATO. Area: Security Policy and National Budget. Following the Chicago and Tokyo conferences, international donors, particularly the United States, emphasized the rapid increase in the number of Afghan security forces (army and police) to approximately 352,000 personnel. This decision was based more on NATO's military objectives than on an assessment of Afghanistan's economic and administrative capacity. Why was it against national interests? The Afghan government had warned that the national budget could not afford to pay the salaries, logistics, and maintenance of this number of troops, but accepted the proposal due to its dependence on foreign aid. Negative consequences: Creating strong financial dependence; over 90% of security expenditures were paid for by foreign aid. After aid was reduced in the years 1398-1400, livelihoods and equipping units faced difficulties. Inability to maintain expensive equipment and aircraft that could only be operated by foreign specialists. Decreased morale and the collapse of the command structure in the final months of the regime.|The intervention of the international community should be contingent on non-interference in political and economic decision-making. Foreign aid should be provided with full transparency and comprehensive oversight. Prevent rent-seeking. The information vacuum is filled and independent institutions are formed for oversight.\n",
    "ID_S2_025|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|: A) In short and concise terms, a decision by a senior Afghan government official that prioritized national interests over ethnic interests, and which had positive results, led the government to decide in the years 2011-2021 to implement the important infrastructure project of constructing a major highway that begins at the Kabul axis and ends in Bamyan and Daikundi, as well as along the Baghlan route, which connects the aforementioned provinces to the center of Kabul, based on national priorities. Despite political and ethnic pressures to divert funds to specific routes and regions, the project was implemented in accordance with public needs and national interests. The importance of this project was that it connected several central and northern provinces of Afghanistan with each other and with the capital. Result: - Transportation routes and the movement of merchants' goods between the aforementioned provinces were facilitated, and costs were reduced. - Public satisfaction increased, and people's trust in the government and the ruling system grew. - This project was one of the national projects in the decade (2010-2020) that was implemented regardless of ethnic affiliation. - The connection of the Herat, Badghis, Faryab, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Ghazni routes, where people from the mentioned regions live with different ethnicities and languages, has connected their network, which demonstrates effective leadership free from ethnic interests. - Result: Positive, and its consequences: - Connecting important central, northern, and western provinces, reducing travel costs and facilitating travel for passengers, transporting goods, and increasing trade between provinces. - Widespread public satisfaction and increased trust between the people of the provinces and the center emerged. -Note: If you wish, you can also consider the road network and the connection of the Bamyan, Yakawlang-Kotel-e Qonaq-Nili (the center of Daikundi) and Jaghori routes as part of this large national network. B) Making a decision that was influenced by ethnic bias and had an unsuccessful and ineffective outcome: During the period 2011-2021, actions and measures were taken in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health based on ethnic tendencies, network affiliation, and group affiliation, which: - In the Ministry of Education and Health, appointments and placements of individuals in key positions were made based on ethnic and group affiliation, while specialized and experienced staff were sidelined and individuals lacking experience and expertise were appointed to important and key positions. - In the years 2016-2018, official reports from Faryab, Paktia, Logar, and Takhar provinces showed that: - School construction and textbook printing projects were delayed due to poor management and corruption. - The books were not distributed on time. - Corruption in contracts increased. - Some donor-funded projects were canceled. - This is a clear example of decision-making failure influenced by bias.|Widespread corruption clearly had negative effects on international projects. There are specific examples of projects being delayed due to corruption. The National Rural Water Supply Program project in Uruzgan and Helmand provinces from 2014-2016, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in collaboration with the World Bank, carried out rural water supply projects. According to information (reports) from Uruzgan and Helmand: - Local contractors embezzled part of the budget. - The drilling quality was unsatisfactory, and the water tank preparation was of poor quality. - The financial documents lacked transparency. Result: The World Bank halted the project for several months, and thousands of families were left without access to clean water. Reduced service quality: Health programs in the Ministry of Public Health, in 2017, in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, and Farah, reported that health implementing companies had illegally withdrawn a portion of the budget, which resulted in: - Clinics were left without medicine or medical supplies. - Employe salaries haven't been paid for months. - Maternal and child mortality increased, and the quality of health service delivery severely declined and even collapsed. - Cutting off foreign aid due to corruption: The printing and publication of textbooks in the Ministry of Education in 1397 (solar year) was supported by international donors, especially the European Union. After the exposure of corruption in the printing and publication contracts for hundreds of thousands of textbooks for education students, the following decisions were made: - They completely cut off the budget that had been allocated. - The project's execution was halted pending complete reviews. - Millions of students were unable to receive books in the next academic year. - The Ministry of Education's credibility was questioned and the level of trust in it decreased significantly.|The effects of the gap between formal and traditional institutions. There are clear examples where projects have faced difficulties in implementation due to poor cooperation between formal and traditional institutions. In Baghlan Province - Burka District: Problems and conflicts over the distribution of irrigation canal water in 2015. Without coordinating or consulting with local elders, the government implemented a new water distribution plan. This action resulted in: - Two villages entered into conflict and dispute. - Several acres of land were destroyed. - The canal improvement project was halted for several months. Matters that have been resolved correctly and effectively due to effective cooperation between formal and traditional institutions: In Herat Province, Injil District: Problems and disputes arose between the two families (tribes) regarding irrigated lands. To resolve this issue, the government, in collaboration with the local council, the tribal jirga, the land authorities, held joint meetings and sessions, which resulted in: - The conflict was resolved non-violently. - The land was officially registered by the government. - The irrigation project that was beyond was implemented without any problems.|How foreign aid affects the government's independent decision-making. A) Supportive effects on government decision-making: In the years 2011-2016, the United States and NATO insisted and emphasized the implementation of development budgets in the security sector. Donors insisted that more budget be spent on creating security forces, building bases, and equipping the police. The government was forced to: - Transfer a large portion of development budget from economic and infrastructure projects to security-focused (security) projects. B) Negative consequences and repercussions (contrary to national interests) that resulted in the following: - Economic projects (road construction, energy, agriculture) were underfunded and poorly developed. - The level of economic growth decreased and slowed down. - The country's dependence on foreign aid increased. - It created public dissatisfaction with the lack of development services.|Practical recommendations for the future (Framework for assistance) Based on the lessons learned over the years and real-world experience in Afghan society, how should it be and what should be done? Based on past experiences, it is suggested that international aid to Afghanistan (a post-conflict country) be implemented in a hybrid model. How? - 50% of the aid will be implemented and operationalized thru the national government budget, under the supervision of an independent body, civil society councils, and the media. - 50% of the aid will be implemented thru independent donor projects to reduce the risks of politicization and corruption. Perhaps we can find an example of this model in the Citizen Contract Program (CCNPP), where local community monitoring led to greater transparency and trust. It is also worth noting that at the same time and during that era, the helpers maintained their technical roles, which had a positive outcome.\"\"\"\n",

The Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Directorate, without consulting the village council and local elders, decided to change the water distribution route in the secondary canal to help the new irrigation project. Local leaders and the local council considered this decision unilateral and contrary to the previous agreement, and prevented its implementation. The government was also unable to implement the decision without local support. Result : The channel remained closed for about two months. Agricultural lands in both villages were dry and damaged. Physical and armed clashes occurred between young people from two villages, and several people were injured. The issue was only temporarily resolved after a joint council was formed between the government and local elders.|It is clear that non-discretionary budgets (foreign aid) have a negative impact on the independent decision-making of government institutions. A specific answer will be provided below. Decision Topic: Increasing the size of security forces beyond the country\u001b[39m\u001b[33m'\u001b[39m\u001b[33ms financial capacity Time: 2011-2014. Effective Donor: United States and NATO. Area: Security Policy and National Budget. Following the Chicago and Tokyo conferences, international donors, particularly the United States, emphasized the rapid increase in the number of Afghan security forces (army and police) to approximately 352,000 personnel. This decision was based more on NATO\u001b[39m\u001b[33m'\u001b[39m\u001b[33ms military objectives than on an assessment of Afghanistan\u001b[39m\u001b[33m'\u001b[39m\u001b[33ms economic and administrative capacity. Why was it against national interests? The Afghan government had warned that the national budget could not afford to pay the salaries, logistics, and maintenance of this number of troops, but accepted the proposal due to its dependence on foreign aid. Negative consequences: Creating strong financial dependence; over 90\u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;132;01m% o\u001b[39;00m\u001b[33mf security expenditures were paid for by foreign aid. After aid was reduced in the years 1398-1400, livelihoods and equipping units faced difficulties. Inability to maintain expensive equipment and aircraft that could only be operated by foreign specialists. Decreased morale and the collapse of the command structure in the final months of the regime.|The intervention of the international community should be contingent on non-interference in political and economic decision-making. Foreign aid should be provided with full transparency and comprehensive oversight. Prevent rent-seeking. The information vacuum is filled and independent institutions are formed for oversight.\u001b[39m\n\u001b[32m    136\u001b[39m \u001b[33mID_S2_025|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|: A) In short and concise terms, a decision by a senior Afghan government official that prioritized national interests over ethnic interests, and which had positive results, led the government to decide in the years 2011-2021 to implement the important infrastructure project of constructing a major highway that begins at the Kabul axis and ends in Bamyan and Daikundi, as well as along the Baghlan route, which connects the aforementioned provinces to the center of Kabul, based on national priorities. Despite political and ethnic pressures to divert funds to specific routes and regions, the project was implemented in accordance with public needs and national interests. The importance of this project was that it connected several central and northern provinces of Afghanistan with each other and with the capital. Result: - Transportation routes and the movement of merchants\u001b[39m\u001b[33m'\u001b[39m\u001b[33m goods between the aforementioned provinces were facilitated, and costs were reduced. - Public satisfaction increased, and people\u001b[39m\u001b[33m'\u001b[39m\u001b[33ms trust in the government and the ruling system grew. - This project was one of the national projects in the decade (2010-2020) that was implemented regardless of ethnic affiliation. - The connection of the Herat, Badghis, Faryab, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Ghazni routes, where people from the mentioned regions live with different ethnicities and languages, has connected their network, which demonstrates effective leadership free from ethnic interests. - Result: Positive, and its consequences: - Connecting important central, northern, and western provinces, reducing travel costs and facilitating travel for passengers, transporting goods, and increasing trade between provinces. - Widespread public satisfaction and increased trust between the people of the provinces and the center emerged. -Note: If you wish, you can also consider the road network and the connection of the Bamyan, Yakawlang-Kotel-e Qonaq-Nili (the center of Daikundi) and Jaghori routes as part of this large national network. B) Making a decision that was influenced by ethnic bias and had an unsuccessful and ineffective outcome: During the period 2011-2021, actions and measures were taken in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health based on ethnic tendencies, network affiliation, and group affiliation, which: - In the Ministry of Education and Health, appointments and placements of individuals in key positions were made based on ethnic and group affiliation, while specialized and experienced staff were sidelined and individuals lacking experience and expertise were appointed to important and key positions. - In the years 2016-2018, official reports from Faryab, Paktia, Logar, and Takhar provinces showed that: - School construction and textbook printing projects were delayed due to poor management and corruption. - The books were not distributed on time. - Corruption in contracts increased. - Some donor-funded projects were canceled. - This is a clear example of decision-making failure influenced by bias.|Widespread corruption clearly had negative effects on international projects. There are specific examples of projects being delayed due to corruption. The National Rural Water Supply Program project in Uruzgan and Helmand provinces from 2014-2016, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in collaboration with the World Bank, carried out rural water supply projects. According to information (reports) from Uruzgan and Helmand: - Local contractors embezzled part of the budget. - The drilling quality was unsatisfactory, and the water tank preparation was of poor quality. - The financial documents lacked transparency. Result: The World Bank halted the project for several months, and thousands of families were left without access to clean water. Reduced service quality: Health programs in the Ministry of Public Health, in 2017, in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, and Farah, reported that health implementing companies had illegally withdrawn a portion of the budget, which resulted in: - Clinics were left without medicine or medical supplies. - Employe salaries haven\u001b[39m\u001b[33m'\u001b[39m\u001b[33mt been paid for months. - Maternal and child mortality increased, and the quality of health service delivery severely declined and even collapsed. - Cutting off foreign aid due to corruption: The printing and publication of textbooks in the Ministry of Education in 1397 (solar year) was supported by international donors, especially the European Union. After the exposure of corruption in the printing and publication contracts for hundreds of thousands of textbooks for education students, the following decisions were made: - They completely cut off the budget that had been allocated. - The project\u001b[39m\u001b[33m'\u001b[39m\u001b[33ms execution was halted pending complete reviews. - Millions of students were unable to receive books in the next academic year. - The Ministry of Education\u001b[39m\u001b[33m'\u001b[39m\u001b[33ms credibility was questioned and the level of trust in it decreased significantly.|The effects of the gap between formal and traditional institutions. There are clear examples where projects have faced difficulties in implementation due to poor cooperation between formal and traditional institutions. In Baghlan Province - Burka District: Problems and conflicts over the distribution of irrigation canal water in 2015. Without coordinating or consulting with local elders, the government implemented a new water distribution plan. This action resulted in: - Two villages entered into conflict and dispute. - Several acres of land were destroyed. - The canal improvement project was halted for several months. Matters that have been resolved correctly and effectively due to effective cooperation between formal and traditional institutions: In Herat Province, Injil District: Problems and disputes arose between the two families (tribes) regarding irrigated lands. To resolve this issue, the government, in collaboration with the local council, the tribal jirga, the land authorities, held joint meetings and sessions, which resulted in: - The conflict was resolved non-violently. - The land was officially registered by the government. - The irrigation project that was beyond was implemented without any problems.|How foreign aid affects the government\u001b[39m\u001b[33m'\u001b[39m\u001b[33ms independent decision-making. A) Supportive effects on government decision-making: In the years 2011-2016, the United States and NATO insisted and emphasized the implementation of development budgets in the security sector. Donors insisted that more budget be spent on creating security forces, building bases, and equipping the police. The government was forced to: - Transfer a large portion of development budget from economic and infrastructure projects to security-focused (security) projects.

    "ID_S1_004|10/25/2025 4:19:02|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|2016–2021|After 2001, it was essential for any Afghan leader to enjoy comprehensive rule and strategic legitimacy. First, comprehensive rule was necessary to pursue the unification of Afghanistan's religions, ethnicities, and tribes into a single state and national identity. Years of violent conflict had torn apart the fabric of Afghan society, and almost everywhere in Afghanistan, the risk of destruction from political unrest was higher than usual. Only through leadership that embraces power sharing and representation can Afghanistan hope to achieve a certain level of political stability and social cohesion. Second, as much as reestablishing state authority will be part of the maturation of the Afghan state, strategic legitimacy locally, regionally, and globally will be fundamental to this transformation. Domestic legitimacy has been based on two main objectives: responding to citizens' needs and providing a minimum level of services, and respecting Islamic and traditional values, which are also important elements of domestic legitimacy. Restoring international legitimacy and gaining a certain level of diplomatic credibility requires some ability to counter foreign influence and address negative perceptions of living under the tutelage of external actors and their sovereign powers. Without a legitimate foundation, any government risks being seen as an external power transfer, and the absence of legitimacy undermines any progress toward long-term stability.|Afghan leaders have made progress, but they also have to deal with ongoing challenges in bringing together formal government institutions and traditional institutions like the Loya Jirga and local councils. Programs such as the Loya Jirga and the National Solidarity Program have involved local leaders in some decision-making and development initiatives, although they have not always been effective. In many locations, local loyalties, instability, and lack of government capacity have made it difficult to fully integrate these systems.|Heavy reliance on foreign funding and technical assistance hampered the development of self-reliant and accountable strategic thinking among Afghan leaders, as donors predetermined or influenced a large portion of the budget and major projects. As a result, leaders generally felt compelled to prioritize donor commitments over national priorities. This, in turn, fostered a dependency mindset that stifled initiative and weakened local accountability, as success came to be defined more by satisfying foreign partners than by addressing the realities faced by Afghan citizens.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Neutral|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Neutral|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|Aside from the financial situation, the significant weakness affecting service delivery and policy implementation was the limited capability and expertise in government institutions. Many ministries and local offices did not have qualified staff, systems, or coordination, which ultimately created significant obstacles to mobilize plans into action. This affected timeliness, productivity, and public frustrations across all sectors, including health, education, and infrastructure. |Inability to provide security|An example is Afghanistan's National Solidarity Program (NSP), which empowered people at the community level through Community Development Councils. By engaging with local elders and taking into account customary decision-making processes, the program was culturally appropriate and unearthed community priorities delivering educational, transportation, and water infrastructure. Conversely, programs that did not respect cultural contexts were likely to be rejected by communities, underscoring the critical importance of cultural appropriateness in programming.|The key takeaway from 2001-2021 is that effective and acceptable governance is not created just from external funding or external institutions; it has to be central to local political reality and social trust. In Afghanistan, efforts were primarily centered on creating a formal structure and the institution needed to satisfy donor expectations, yet when institutions lacked legitimacy to traditional leadership, customary practices, and citizen need, they were often presented an illusion of legitimacy. Sustainable governance requires a balance between contemporary state institutions and local authority, security, the provision of basic services, and accountability grounded in the people themselves.|Not provided\n",

In addition, he should have the ability to build national consensus and trust among active political institutions, local and customary structures, civil society, and international partners so that his decisions are implemented with broad national support.|The traditional structure has always been preferred; even the formal institution was managed with a traditional perspective, so we conclude that the link between these two institutions was the dominance of tradition over the formal structure.|Heavy reliance on foreign aid has led to a decline in nationalism, weakened local government accountability, and discouraged independent strategic thinking. As a result, policymaking has been based more on external expectations than on the real needs of local communities and institutions.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Lack of capacity in Afghan government institutions, conflicting priorities, lack of coordination among donor countries, rampant corruption, and security challenges|The biggest internal weakness was the lack of an effective management and coordination system between government institutions. This problem led to overlapping tasks, parallel work, lack of accountability, and failure to implement policies at the national level, resulting in services not reaching citizens effectively even when resources were available.|Widespread corruption|A notable example of this is the land registration reform program. Designed to promote transparency and reduce land disputes, the program failed to deliver positive results in many areas due to poor coordination with social structures and local values, such as the role of jirga councils and people's trust in local mediation. People continued to view local solutions as more credible and fair than resorting to official channels.|The most important lesson of this course is that effective and legitimate governance is sustainable when its political and social ownership arises from within the society, not imposed from without. In a country like Afghanistan, legitimacy does not come from the ballot box or international support alone; it requires internal consensus, coherence with the cultural and social context, transparency, and genuine participation of the people in decision-making. Governance is strengthened when formal state structures, local community values, and traditional institutions are connected; stability and legitimacy are undermined when this connection is ignored.|Yes! An important point that has been less addressed is the importance of institutional continuity in the process of state-building in Afghanistan. Experience has shown that extensive, accelerated, and person-centered changes in leadership, diplomacy, and government structures have caused no policy or program to survive. In the absence of continuity, capacities were not accumulated, historical memory was not formed, and each government effectively started from scratch. In my opinion, if policies and institutions had structural stability, a culture of accountability, and a program-centered approach, many domestic and international efforts in the path of state-building in Afghanistan would have had more lasting and effective results.\n",

For example, the success of some local governors in development projects, such as improving water supply systems in villages, was due to their understanding of the needs of the people and their interaction with traditional leaders, while similar projects failed in areas with leaders who were less experienced or unfamiliar with the local culture.\n",
    "ID_S1_012|10/26/2025 17:36:30|Former Afghan Government Official|2011–2015, 2016–2021|In my opinion, given Afghanistan's unique characteristics, not only over the past 20 years but also in the future, an effective leader can only be effective if, as a first step, they have a cross-ethnic vision for the country and consider Afghanistan to be connected to and dependent on all of its ethnic groups. Second, they must be specialized. To overcome and properly manage the crisis, they must assemble a team of experts to organize matters with complete competence, experience, and understanding. In short, a cross-ethnic vision and a specialized, experience-centered vision are essential characteristics of an effective leader in Afghanistan.|Afghan leaders managed to build relationships between official institutions and traditional structures to some extent, but this balance was unstable. For example, during the reigns of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, the Loya Jirga councils were used for national decision-making, but no sustainable coordination with government institutions was established.|Unfortunately, Afghanistan was completely dependent on aid from the international community, and this total dependence meant that, in times of crisis and decision-making, the country's leaders were unable to make independent decisions based on the national interests of the country. As a result, the outcome and repercussions of this situation were exactly what the United States wanted.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Widespread corruption|I disagree with the lack of financial resources. Well, if we take that into account, in addition to that, the prevalence of corruption and the appointment of individuals based on connections rather than qualifications were important factors in the poor delivery of services and the failure to implement policies.|Widespread corruption|The most prominent example I can give is the country's master plan for electricity, which the country's leaders changed against the interests of the Afghan people due to ethnic biases, leaving Afghanistan in darkness to this day. It is a very detailed story that cannot be described here.|I think the biggest lesson that can be learned is that if a country like Afghanistan wants to emerge from the crisis, they must be careful in choosing and appointing their leaders, they must vote for people who will work for Afghanistan, and in the second step, the priority of the leaders and all the people should be the collective interests of the country. We voted based on ethnic affiliations, the leaders decided based on their ethnic affiliations, and the result was that the country became more critical. The big lesson is to appoint people based on their competence, honesty, and expertise, not ethnic affiliations, language, etc. In short, post-conflict countries need competent and honest people who prioritize the interests of the country above everything else.|While recalling the issues mentioned above, the most important issue that is vital for Afghanistan is governance away from emotions; over the past few decades, we have tried to turn the country into a battlefield and a conflict between neighbors with emotional policies. Afghanistan will not develop unless a neighbor called Pakistan feels at ease with us. Strategic wisdom dictates that we observe moderation in our relations between India and Pakistan to protect ourselves from possible harm from Pakistan, which we have unfortunately not done so far.\n",
    "ID_S1_013|10/26/2025 17:42:03|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|2011–2015|In my opinion, the two most important qualities for an effective Afghan leader after 2001 were: 1. The ability to build national unity: After years of war and ethnic conflict, an effective leader must be able to build trust and solidarity among different groups, ethnicities, and religions in order to lay the foundations for a sustainable nation-state. 2. Commitment to transparency and fighting corruption: During the reconstruction period in Afghanistan, rampant corruption was one of the main challenges. A leader who emphasizes transparency, accountability, and justice is able to maintain the trust of the people and the international community and make the development process sustainable.|Unfortunately, customs and traditions still prevail in many parts of the country, and tribal values are paramount. On the other hand, during the 20-year republic, some outsiders did not believe in these customs and traditions, and some even showed an excessive desire to use them to polish their image in front of the public by respecting customs and traditions. In my opinion, the result of these trends was a more critical situation in the country. We have multifaceted crises and problems in the country that must be solved with modern science, a specialized perspective, and effective diplomacy, or at least a reasonable solution must be found for them. However, not only did we lack a logical and specialized perspective in this area, but we also wanted to solve the country's most sensitive problems through the Loya Jirga, a council whose members are mostly illiterate or have limited education. In fact, the country's constitution stipulates that the constitution can be amended through the Loya Jirga, although it has its own procedures. In my opinion, after 2001, Afghan leaders were only able to build effective bridges between official state institutions and traditional structures, such as local councils and jirgas, to a limited extent. On the one hand, attempts were made to use traditional structures in decision-making. For example, the 2003 Constitutional Loya Jirga, the Consultative Peace Jirga, and the Jirga for the Release of Taliban Prisoners in subsequent years were examples of using local traditions to legitimize national decisions. These councils helped people feel that they had a stake in the political process. On the other hand, in many cases, a gap remained between the central government and local structures. The government failed to integrate these traditional institutions into the formal system in a sustainable manner.

In short, attempts were made to build links, but these links were not sustainable or institutionalized, and one of the main weaknesses in the Afghan state-building process remained.|Overreliance on international financial and technical assistance has had profound effects on the development of independent strategic thinking among Afghan leaders. On the one hand, this reliance has led to the country's overall planning and decision-making being influenced by the priorities, policies, and interests of donor countries, rather than the real needs of Afghan society. As a result, many leaders focused on attracting foreign support to seize power and manage aid resources, rather than on developing sustainable national strategies. On the other hand, this situation has weakened the culture of domestic accountability; when budgets and resources are mainly provided from abroad, leaders feel less pressure to be accountable to the people. In other words, they derived their legitimacy more from international support than from public satisfaction. As a result, excessive reliance on foreign aid has hindered the growth of intellectual independence, institutional self-sufficiency, and political accountability among the Afghan leadership.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not very effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, rampant corruption, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|In addition to a lack of financial resources, one of the most notable internal weaknesses of Afghan state institutions was their lack of effective administrative and organizational capacities, coupled with rampant corruption.

Leaders and government officials have attempted to use this method to make decisions that address the country's best interests. However, in modern governance, non-traditional institutions that are not formed on the basis of a social contract do not have sufficient authority and credibility to make major decisions at the national level. Leaders or political elites in Afghanistan, who were in fact the traditional leaders of society, believed in this method as a solution to major national problems. Before the Taliban came to power, Afghan governments often turned to consultative jirga councils to resolve national issues and even make decisions affecting their foreign policy.

Second, he must be honest and accountable to his people—a leader who stands with his people, leads them through their pain, grief, and hopes, and leads them with honesty.|He believes that Afghan leaders have many ways to build an effective relationship between formal government institutions and traditional communities and structures. Most of the time, both systems were in a state of distrust. The executive branch of the high command spent a lot of time on energy, which was important to him. On the other hand, traditional and tribal councils are crowded with government officials, have elders who do not trust them, and are rife with political corruption. In addition, traditional and local councils are more isolated from the armed forces and the opposition. Some political leaders have tried, but unfortunately, their symbolic efforts have been short-lived. In the case of the Loya Jirga, a local jirga was formed, the debate was managed, and everything was symbolic of his policies. Overall, this relationship remained incomplete—neither traditional structures, nor formal government institutions, nor the trust of the people were strengthened.|I believe that the country has relied too heavily on foreign political leaders and financial and technical assistance, which has weakened Afghan leaders' sense of national responsibility and independent strategic thinking. When equipment is the last important part of the organization, we can clearly see how weak mid-level government managers are, as well as their independence, strategic thinking, and responsibility. The sense of ownership of the country and the government has been seriously damaged, and the country has become heavily dependent on foreigners and their financial and technical assistance. After 2016, many leaders tried to reduce dependence on the homeland and restore responsibility. Remember some examples. For example, in 2016, Americans seriously discussed strengthening the country's air force. Similarly, we have only 157 Black Hawk helicopters. The air force has received dozens of transport and large military equipment, giant fighter jets, fighter jets, and bombers. Every six months, dozens of young people in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Europe, and the United States receive training in the Air Force. For example, when the former president seriously discussed the Case Management System (CMS), he took the matter to the US Supreme Court. In front of millions of American citizens, biometric data and its transfer were discussed, the nationality of topographic information was discussed, security responsibilities were transferred, and he also had a lot of work under his control, but he did his best, did not feel ownership, relied on foreign countries, and ultimately paved the way for the fall.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|I believe that the most serious impact is weak internal institutions, corruption, political interference, and weak capacity (capacity gap).

The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) launched the Afghan National Integration Program around 2003 with the help of the World Bank. This program aims to empower villagers to make decisions and develop and implement projects. De Biera's factors: 1. Social values of harmony: The Afghan Rural Council Program, the Jirga Council, and the Partnership should be established. The villagers chose the Shura Council (Village Development Council) and decided to implement the project (road, water, school, bridge, electricity, etc.). 2. Trust and sense of ownership among the people: When the people participated in decision-making, they felt that they were managing the project themselves, not the government or foreigners. Corruption became more difficult. 3. Gradual participation of women: In areas where traditional restrictions exist, the structure of women's councils should be introduced gradually and cautiously. Da Franji prevented conflict and paved the way for Kibledo. The result: more than 35,000 projects benefited from the National Solidarity Program, and thousands of small development projects improved people's lives. The Community Development Program of the World Bank and other institutions is a successful example.

This leader must have strategic leadership and the ability to make decisive decisions in order to pursue a clear strategy for the country's stability, security, and long-term economic growth. A close relationship with the people and a deep understanding of the nation's needs and values are also essential for a leader, as the trust of the people is the foundation of any legitimate system. In addition, the leader of international relations must have the ability to manage effectively, so that the national interests of Afghanistan and its international partners are protected in a balanced manner.|After 2001, the Afghan government leadership faced political and administrative complexities in achieving an effective balance between formal institutions and traditional community structures, namely jirgas and local councils. The political and social reality in Afghanistan shows that traditional structures of legitimacy, arbitration, and social order are based on historical provisions, while formal government institutions represent modern governance, accountability, and the rule of law. Although some leaders have attempted to integrate the two by establishing consultative councils, these efforts have often failed to achieve effective coordination and long-term action. For example, the adoption of the Loya Jirga constitution and the participation of the people is a symbolic example, and the decision itself has not been fully implemented at the political or administrative level of the Loya government. Overall, the efforts of Afghan leaders and formal and informal institutions to build an effective bridge have been limited because they do not appreciate traditions and structures. This should be recognized as an authentic form, not only in modern state-building, but also in line with the principles of a sustainable framework.|His analysis, leadership of Afghanistan, international financial and technical assistance, and heavy reliance on independent strategic thinking and responsiveness had a profound impact on the institution. This dependence has often forced leaders to follow the requirements and conditions of international donors, limiting their ability to make independent, long-term policy decisions. It will also weaken the culture of accountability, because decisions about responsibility and accountability will, in most cases, depend on foreign institutions and their expectations.

In addition, deficiencies in internal organizational structures, centralized decision-making, high centralization, lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms, and weak inter-agency coordination have prevented the effective implementation of policies.

Although the project is not yet complete, Ghani's decision has paved the way for the expansion of regional economic cooperation and the creation of job opportunities for the people of Afghanistan, and has given the country international economic credibility. This is an example where national interests took precedence over ethnic interests and had positive outcomes.|Direct experience from a road construction project in Parwan province in 2017 showed how administrative and financial corruption hinders coordination. During the implementation of the contracts for this project, some contracting companies did not properly adhere to road construction standards, and in some sections, only a thin layer of sand was used. According to reports from local people and the press, the project delays and poor road quality were linked to corruption, as contracts were often awarded in the names of influential individuals. As a result, not only was the road quality poor, but coordination between government agencies and international partners was also slow, and service delivery to local people was affected. This example illustrates how corruption can have a serious negative impact on project implementation, service quality, and the coordination system.|A long-standing water distribution problem in Laghman province of Afghanistan has worsened due to poor cooperation between official institutions and local leaders. The provincial Department of Agriculture tried to start the construction project of a canal, but a place for consultation with the local jirgas and councils was not selected. As a result, some families and tribes considered the canal route as their property, and many difficulties arose against the work. The government agencies relied solely on administrative orders, without providing opportunities for trust and participation to local leaders. The outcome was that the project was delayed, water distribution conflicts increased, and public dissatisfaction grew. This example illustrates that coordination between formal and traditional structures plays a vital role in resolving local conflicts.|The police building program in Afghanistan is an example where foreign aid had a negative impact against national interests. A lot of money was spent by international donors to fund and equip the police, but not enough attention was given to managing and building the capacity of the Afghan government's security sector. This process weakened the Afghan government's sovereignty and was driven solely by foreign priorities, not based on Afghanistan's long-term security needs. As a result, there was an increase in police corruption and a weakening of the government system, which had consequences against national interests.|A practical recommendation for Afghanistan's reconstruction is that the international community should implement each aid project thru Afghanistan's national budget and national institutions, rather than having different projects managed by separate donors. This not only prevents the waste of resources but also helps strengthen the country's governmental capacities. A joint fund should be established for aid, with financial oversight and management thru the Ministry of Finance, and project monitoring given to representatives of the community and government. Project implementation should be based on the consultation and participation of local people to ensure their needs are met correctly and to increase project effectiveness. To this end, the transparency of all projects and the monitoring of results should be done thru financial and non-financial audits. These efforts will contribute to Afghanistan's reconstruction and provide fundamental guidelines for establishing long-term stability. Coordination and clear cooperation between the government and international donors are essential to achieve the highest standards of project effectiveness and efficiency.\n",

    "ID_S2_009|International Diplomat/Representative of an International Organization|Regarding the transnational leader: In 2020, I was working at the Ministry of Water and Energy as the Director of Water Affairs Regulation for the General Directorate of the Kabul River Basin. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, initiated a move to divide the Ministry of Water and Energy into two agencies: the National Water Affairs Regulatory Authority and the National Energy Affairs Regulatory Authority. From an administrative perspective, this was a positive and national act because Afghanistan produces approximately 75 billion cubic meters of water annually but is unable to utilize 20% of this total due to mismanagement. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a single agency for comprehensive management of water resources to control Afghanistan's water resources thru a strategic plan spanning approximately 5 years and 10 years. Part A: This was a positive step toward economic growth for the country, improving agriculture from the water infrastructure. Part B: This action by the president failed because the president had ethnic and personal motives for two reasons. First, he turned the ministry into an administration because he wanted to be allowed by the constitution to appoint anyone to head an administration without needing a vote from parliament to elect them. Secondly, according to the agreements of the unity government, the Ministry of Water and Energy belonged to Dr. Abdullah. How could he have his close associates in this ministry when he had turned the ministry into a management?|Corruption as an obstacle to coordination, there were two reasons for the president to carry out widespread corruption. First, he appointed someone close to him to head the administration, and thru this, he was able to implement the infrastructure projects for the imaginary water facilities and add their cost to his capital, which he almost did. Or, he contracted and implemented the infrastructure projects for the water facilities with several companies that were from his own people, and he did. I witnessed several projects; a small example of this was the maintenance and care of the Darunta Dam, which cost approximately 53 million Afghanis. This project was contracted by a company from his own people, and it can be said that this project was contracted for 25 million. Secondly, according to the law, the head of the administration was appointed by the president, and this head of the administration was accountable and reported to no one other than the president. Even Parliament, the embodiment of the people's will, did not have the authority to remove or hold them accountable.|Regarding the gap between the formal and dominant institutions, I must say that since the ministries and departments were restructured, the president, according to the constitution, had the authority to choose the head of the department himself. Parliament, which represented the people, had no vote or authority in this process. For this reason, a person close to power or with political influence was usually appointed to head the departments, rather than technical and expert individuals. The person who was appointed only reported to the president and was not accountable to any other institution. For example, in the Surkh Rod district of Nangarhar province (the Sultanpur area), a project to build a protective wall was implemented. I don't remember the exact cost, but it was very high. This project was approved thru the Ministry of Energy and Water at the time. The wall was supposed to be two and a half meters high below ground, hidden from public view, but it was only built to a height of about one and a half meters; another meter remained incomplete, and unsuitable materials were used. When the flood came, the wall collapsed and caused extensive damage to people's land. People complained, but because the head of the department and his close associates were involved at the top of the project, no one dared to follow up. The implementing company was also owned by the head of the department himself and was mostly selected based on ethnic ties. At that time, such disputes were unsolvable because when the project is the government itself and the government's power is behind it, the people have no way to resist. As a result, the problem remained unresolved and no authority had the jurisdiction to investigate.|At the National Water Resources Management Authority where I worked, foreign aid played a very effective role. No independent decisions were made; most projects were funded thru the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and the implementation of the projects depended on these resources. When the Ministry of Energy and Water was transformed into the National Water Regulatory Authority, a new problem arose: the authority was no longer accountable to parliament because its head was appointed by the president and only reported to him. There was no regulatory authority (except for the president himself). For this reason, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank stopped their aid. They said, \"We will not give money to an office that is not accountable and cannot be questioned.\" While the minister was approved by parliament and accountable to the people when the ministry existed. However, the administration lacked such legitimacy, which is why many of the projects that were in the plan were not implemented and remained unfinished.|Based on my experience with the reconstruction situation in Afghanistan, if the international community wants to intervene in post-war countries, it should provide aid thru non-governmental and international organizations (NGOs), not directly thru the government. Because when aid is channeled thru the government, there is usually nepotism, ethnic discrimination, and widespread corruption. The minister gives orders to his close associates, they pass them on to their employes, and the result is that the budget doesn't reach the real people. But in the international model: • A donor entity provides the funds, and a specific institution implements the project. • The second body independently (directly or indirectly) monitors whether the aid has reached the intended recipients. • Separate oversight reduces corruption and increases transparency. For this reason, if aid is provided thru international organizations and strong monitoring teams are in place, no one can act against global standards and people will benefit more from the results.\n",

Local officials suggested the road route pass thru more populated areas so more people could benefit, but because the final decision was made at the Kabul headquarters with the input of foreign consultants, the less beneficial route was chosen. The project was implemented at a high cost but with less benefit.|Afghanistan's experience shows that when decisions are made without consulting the people, transparency, and a national perspective, the outcome is usually failure; whether in ethnic decisions, government and administrative discussions, or projects implemented under foreign influence. Therefore, in any future international intervention, the aid framework should revolve around a few principles: first, national ownership – decisions should be made domestically, with the leadership of the government and local people, not in foreign offices, and not with the ethnic bias of past governments. Second, accountability and transparency – all projects must be implemented thru the national budget to enable monitoring and accountability. Third, public consultation – local councils and community elders should be involved in project design and monitoring from the outset to prevent ethnic and social conflicts. And in the financial resources section, there needs to be very close monitoring and auditing to prevent financial corruption.\n",

Decision-making regarding priorities and budget was primarily done in Kabul and by foreign entities, without considering the actual needs of the people. Health centers were built in a few districts of the province, but permanent human resources and budget were not provided for them. The projects were seemingly completed but closed down after a few months. This dependence on external decisions made the local government feel powerless to manage independently.|Practical recommendations for the future based on my personal experiences. Aid should be managed and monitored thru local councils, namely Jirgas and Development Councils, not just from Kabul or foreign institutions. Local people should have a direct role in all stages, from planning to consumption. The reason is that in projects where the people of Ghor were involved in decision-making, such as some national solidarity and citizenship programs, there was less corruption and the work was actually completed. However, in projects where decisions were made in Kabul or by foreigners, more funds were wasted and there was no accountability.\n",

    "ID_S2_016|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|During the rule of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan under Presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, senior officials served who prioritized national interests over ethnic, partisan, and religious interests. A prime example of this could be the extension of the security agreement between the Afghan government and NATO, which resulted in national security and national interests being guarantyd for a specific period. In contrast, a limited number of party leaders working within the government structure prioritized ethnic interests over national interests, and their ethnic policies widened divisions among the people, ultimately undermining national unity. Political parties active in Afghanistan were operating with an expanding ethnic agenda to attract supporters and win elections. Parties should not have considered ethnic, regional, linguistic, religious, or other factors that harm national interests and unity as criteria for their activities. As a result, division among the people increased and hopes for a bright future diminished. Afghanistan's credibility with the international community diminished and international aid was limited. Because most of these aids were misused by these individuals, and the path to Afghanistan's growth and development was challenged.|One sector that did not yield positive results due to widespread administrative corruption was Afghanistan's education sector. Due to the existence of ghost schools and teachers, most of the government's money and budget was embezzled by ministers and senior officials. Cases of administrative corruption in Afghan courts speak to the widespread corruption and lack of transparency. International aid, without effective accountability from ministry leaders, led to delays in the delivery of international assistance and a decline in the quality of education in the country.|International aid provided to Afghanistan should have been implemented in full coordination with the local people thru beneficial projects. Most areas of Afghanistan lack access to safe water, and projects implemented by international NGOs like DACAAR to improve access to safe water often faced implementation difficulties due to local conflicts. Every village or location wanted to implement these projects in their areas, but due to budget constraints, it was difficult for the aid received to reach all vulnerable areas. In many cases, local people prevented the implementation of foreign projects due to security concerns and the activities of armed opponents in their areas. In some cases, these issues were resolved in coordination with local CDC councils, and the local people provided specific conditions to allow these projects to be adapted. For example, the water supply project in Badakhshan and Kunar provinces, which were insecure and had limited access to the government, was implemented with the advice and coordination of local councils because these were humanitarian aid and did not pursue political goals, so the local people allowed the implementation. In conflict-ridden areas, there are widespread disputes over water sources, including the legal ownership of these water resources, which is contested by local people. This has caused project implementation to be delayed or halted.|On the one hand, foreign aid played a very important and vital role for the Afghan government and people in the post-civil war period. However, most of this aid was implemented without oversight and at the discretion of the donor countries, and the Afghan people were unaware of the amount of this aid and how it was spent. Civil activists have mostly expressed their concern that the lack of transparency in the use of domestic budgets and international aid undermines the effectiveness of these contributions. In some cases, donor countries often prioritized their national interests over foreign aid. For example, the aid provided by the Iranian government to the office of Hamid Karzai's government was due to American political and military competition, and they demanded their interests in return for this aid from the Afghan government. The aid that the Indian government continued to provide for the development of Afghanistan was aimed at weakening Pakistan's regional role in the Afghan issue. These factors, which exacerbated regional conflict and competition with neighboring countries, ultimately had a significant impact on national interests and security.|The main recommendation for improving international aid delivery by the global community is to provide transparent mechanisms for implementing these projects so that accountability for these projects is clear to the people. This aid should be under the direct supervision of the people, and the basic priorities of the people should be considered in the preparation of development plans. Afghanistan is in dire need of international aid. Afghanistan is not a poor country and is not in dire need of international aid. The government cannot handle this humanitarian crisis alone, and the international community must continue its assistance. Foreign aid provided by international aid organizations did not reduce poverty in the country due to a lack of transparency, and public distrust of this aid increased. Afghanistan is still an economically weak country, and according to international statistics, Afghanistan faces a harsh winter, making a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan still possible. In order for foreign institutional aid to be effectively implemented in the country, an effective accountability mechanism must be established in coordination with the government, civil society, and people's representatives so that this aid can be effectively implemented and Afghanistan can potentially achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n",

It's very difficult to provide an example of corruption! You might think that if there was so much widespread corruption, why would it be difficult to find such an example? The answer is that in all government projects, corruption was considered part of the job and was so institutionalized that no work could be considered exempt from corruption.

In the implementation of this important project, corruption was rampant and multi-faceted, which both delayed the project's completion and led to the ineffective use of international community aid.|One of the fundamental problems in Afghanistan is the conflict between tradition and modernity. This conflict manifests itself in various forms, sometimes as the government versus traditional society, and at other times in other forms such as modern education and schools, and so on. A large portion of unfinished projects and actions have been due to this conflict. If you look at the annual budget codes, you'll notice that a large portion of the allocated budgets hasn't been used. When you investigate the reason, you'll find that the local people have prevented the project from being implemented, saying it doesn't align with our traditions and customs. Specifically, I can mention the non-implementation of school construction projects in Khost and Logar provinces.|The Geneva meetings and the setting of 21 indicators by donors directly subordinated Afghanistan's policymaking and budget to foreign priorities. Instead of genuine reform, the government manipulated figures and engaged in a superficial fight against corruption to maintain the flow of aid. This process eliminated independent decision-making, institutionalized financial dependence, and sacrificed national interests for the sake of continued foreign aid.|Aid should be spent 100% thru the national budget and under local community oversight, rather than directly injecting currency and creating dependency, and the focus should be on strengthening domestic capacities. Bureaucratic reform, securing property rights, establishing inclusive institutions, targeted anti-corruption efforts, and support for small businesses should be the focus of reconstruction programs to help the country transition from a \"beggar economy\" to a productive and independent one.\n",
    "ID_S2_018|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|Throughout history, especially from 2011 to 2021, ethnic and linguistic interests have always taken precedence over national and international interests, and this was one of the reasons for the government's failure in terms of security, economy, and so on.|Corruption in previous governments was a problem that the government either did not want to prevent or, even if it did, could not prevent the widespread and systemic corruption within the government and among government officials.|No response|In this regard, we can mention the Ghor to Herat and Ghor to Kabul roads, where national interests have been affected by ethnic interests, which have remained unproductive for over twenty years.| If international aid resumes, it doesn't matter what ethnicity or race the leader is. What matters is that they have a service-oriented mindset and that their mind is not limited to one ethnicity or language. Otherwise, the budget should be distributed at the provincial level, and the local people themselves should decide what their priorities are and build accordingly.\n",
    "ID_S2_019|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was influenced by ethnic bias and hegemonic dominance. He removed all qualified individuals from leadership and decision-making bodies and replaced them with unqualified individuals from his own ethnic group, which ultimately led to the fall of the republican government to the Taliban.|Corruption caused international organizations to lose trust in the then Afghan government and reduce their cooperation. For example, in the education sector in every province of Afghanistan, and similarly in every school at the provincial level, there were dozens and hundreds of fictitious teachers (there were no teachers at all). The name of the teacher was all that existed. Money and national budgets were embezzled by individuals at the leadership and management levels of the education sector. As a result, it caused the children of the people not to be absorbed into the education sector, and if they were, it was very little. It was unable to reduce the illiteracy rate as much as it could have.|For example, in Bamyan province (the center of Bamyan), in an area called Khoshkak, nearly a thousand houses have been built. These lands do not have official municipal documents, only customary ones. The government declared them public, and people began construction in this area. The municipality and land administration did not allow people to build here, but people started construction by paying money or using their connections with members of parliament or high-ranking officials of official institutions. However, this institution was unable or unwilling to solve the people's problems at their root, and now, with nearly a thousand homes built, they still lack municipal deeds and maps, and the government considers this land its own. Now the government is in trouble. If it demolishes all these houses, it will cost the government a lot of money, and the people will also be in a state of uncertainty and confusion. This indicates gaps in formal and legal institutions.|In Afghanistan, the president was appointed by the United States of America in consultation with the European Union. Because the United States of America and its partner organizations like USAID, etc., were the biggest contributors in Afghanistan. It caused the people of Afghanistan to lose trust in the democratic and electoral process, as exemplified by the 2019 presidential election, which I myself voted in. However, the voter turnout was really low; the election site staff were just hoping someone would come and cast their vote.|If the international community wants to intervene in a post-conflict country, I have a few recommendations: 1) It must create strong, impartial infrastructure that is in line with the country's culture (such as transparent laws, the rule of law, impartial and accountable election monitoring bodies). 2) If other international organizations provide financial and humanitarian aid, instead of distributing it directly to the people, they should create employment opportunities, for example, by assisting and reviving sectors such as agriculture, handicrafts, and tourism, so that people can become self-sufficient and overcome their problems. 3) Establishing independent, impartial, and accountable media outlets for the people. 4) Establishing democratic institutions where the people themselves can choose their own destiny and their own leader. 5) Local people should have a role in how aid is distributed or consumed. 6) Instead of being consumptive, the focus on how aid is used should be developmental and infrastructural. 7) Instead of being distributed thru NGOs, aid should be created in the form of an agricultural bank or reconstruction. For example, it wants to provide low-interest loans to individuals in the agricultural sector or other businesses. If these individuals are successful, they will be given more loans or their interest will be waived so that people are encouraged to solve their own problems instead of always relying on aid.\n",
    "ID_S2_020|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|President Hamid Karzai's 2013 decision to jointly recruit young people from different ethnic groups to expand the national army is an example where national interests were prioritized over ethnic interests, resulting in a relatively positive outcome. Conversely, the decisions of some politicians during the 2019-2020 elections, which were based on ethnic biases, led to unsuccessful outcomes. a) National interests take precedence over ethnic interests - positive example • Background: From 2011 to 2014, the security situation in Afghanistan was poor and the withdrawal of international forces had been announced. It was necessary for the army and national police to be able to defend the entire country. • Action: Hamid Karzai announced a program to expand the national army, under which young people from different ethnic groups were recruited jointly. The recruitment process was intentionally designed to represent all of Afghanistan instead of a specific ethnic group. • Result: A relative balance was created in the camp's structure, which strengthened the sense of national identity and increased its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. Although problems remained, this decision reflected a transnational vision. b) Decision based on ethnic preferences – a failed example • Background: In the 2019-2020 elections, there was intense competition among political groups. Some high-ranking officials were making decisions to appease their ethnic supporters. • Action: Some politicians, whose support was based on ethnicity, opposed the election results and declared a parallel government. Instead of supporting transparent trends and national unity, decisions became subject to ethnic preferences. • Result: A legitimacy crisis was created, public trust in the government decreased, and the ground was prepared for the Taliban to regroup. This is a clear example of the negative consequences of a lack of national vision.|The Kabul Bank case – a clear example of corruption • Background: Kabul Bank was the largest private bank in Afghanistan and was used to pay salaries and finance development projects. International aid and government financial programs were primarily channeled thru this bank. • Action: Between 2010 and 2013, senior bank officials and individuals close to the government illegally withdrew approximately billion for personal gain. This corruption occurred thru fake loans, personal expenses, and funding political networks. • Result: Projects were halted: Educational and health projects whose salaries and budgets were paid thru Kabul Bank were delayed for several months. The quality of services decreased: Teachers and doctors were unable to continue working due to not receiving their salaries, and the quality of educational and health services declined. Cutting off foreign aid: International partners, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF), suspended aid programs to Afghanistan until the government takes serious action against corruption. By October 2012, only a small portion of the stolen money had been recovered, severely damaging global trust. Consonance obstacle (harmony) • This case showed that corruption is not just a domestic problem, but also erodes the trust of international partners. • The cessation and cutting of aid destroyed the atmosphere of cooperation between the government and the world and became a major obstacle to development projects. Result: The Kabul Bank scandal is a clear answer to this question: corruption causes project delays, reduces service quality, and cuts off foreign aid. This experience proves that the lack of transparency and accountability is the biggest obstacle to coordinating development programs.|The gap between formal and traditional institutions • Province: Helmand • Problem: Conflict over water resources (Helmand River water division) Explanation :In Helmand province, the water distribution problem worsened due to poor cooperation between government agencies and traditional local councils. • Background: The Helmand River's seawater is of vital importance for agriculture. There was no coordination between the government's official programs and the traditional decisions of the local elders. • Result: Water disputes increased, some areas faced water scarcity, and agricultural production decreased. The lack of joint decision-making between formal and traditional institutions hindered problem-solving. Positive control sample • Province: Nangarhar • Problem: Property dispute • Result: Due to effective cooperation between the state court and the local jirga, the land dispute was resolved jointly and both parties accepted the decision. Result: These examples show that when there is no cooperation (like in Helmand), conflicts are prolonged. But when cooperation is effective (like in Nangarhar), the problem is solved relatively successfully.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic autonomy . Example: The 2013-2015 security strategy, which was based on US and NATO assistance. Background • Due to the withdrawal of international forces (2014), the Afghan government was forced to design a large part of its security strategy and budget based on US and NATO aid. • The priority of global war contributors with the Taliban was to help and maintain major cities, not to create widespread local stability. Action • The focus of the national security strategy was placed on cities and highways, as requested by global partners. • Security funding was reduced for remote areas because donors controlled resource allocation according to their own priorities. Negative consequences • Contrary to national interests: The government's need was to secure the villages, but due to external pressure, security was only concentrated in the cities. • Result: The Taliban's influence in remote areas increased. The government's legitimacy decreased. Instead of long-term stability, a short-term defensive strategy was formed that was at odds with national interests. Result: This example shows that when national policy is subject to the priorities of foreign donors, the government's strategic independence is weakened, and the outcome is detrimental to national interests.|Practical advice for the future. Recommendation: Aid should be spent thru the \"national single budget,\" but under the transparent oversight of local people and with independent accountability mechanisms. How to make it practical • 1. National Unified Budget Framework: All global aid must be spent thru the official government budget, not thru separate donor projects. This prevents the creation of parallel offices and ensures coordination with national programs. • 2. Local Monitoring: At the provincial and district levels, people's councils or civil society organizations should monitor the implementation of projects. This reduces corruption and increases public trust. • 3. Independent Accounting: A common accounting system should be established for the use of aid, involving the government, global donors, and civil society. Reasons based on failures • During the reconstruction of Afghanistan, much of the aid was spent outside the government budget, resulting in: or creating parallel offices, or weakening the government's legitimacy, the increase in corruption, and the loss of public trust. Reasons based on successes • Projects implemented thru national budgets and under public supervision (such as some rural development projects) were relatively successful because people considered them \"their own projects.\" Result: To succeed in war-torn countries, aid must be channeled solely thru the national budget and be spent under public oversight and an independent accounting system. This framework prevents corruption, strengthens government legitimacy, and increases public trust.\n",
    "ID_S2_021|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|In the previous government, for example, we had leaders who acted beyond ethnic and linguistic issues and beyond political affiliations, and they achieved positive results from their work. In the example in the \"Integrity\" section, we can cite the Minister of Public Health, Ferozuddin Feroz. Dr. Ferozuddin Feroz acted transnationally, transethnically, and transsectorally in the field of public health, achieving very positive results in the Ministry of Public Health and the health sector. These positive actions led to him being recognized as the best Minister of Public Health in the world.|In the widespread corruption that was known as one of the factors in the previous government, we can give a specific example: the discussion about one of the development projects in Charikar city, Parwan province. Widespread corruption among parliamentary lawyers and local strongmen caused the project to be halted. The concrete and asphalt paving project was for the Charikar city intersection, which is known as the same intersection of resistance. Here, the local strongmen pressured the international body or institution that was the donor for this project, demanding that our share be paid. The same company and the same institution that was the project implementer stopped the project, and it finally reached the point where, after 2021, during the Taliban's rule, the project was completed.|Foreign aid weakens the strategic decisions of the government and the nation because relying on foreign aid stifles initiative and makes us solely dependent on international and foreign assistance and cooperation. That's why we can't choose our own initiative and a correct perspective. For example, US aid and equipment for the training and education of the national army, which was entirely dependent on them, did not benefit the people much, and ultimately, the forces they deployed, Units 01 and 02, were deployed by them based on strategic decisions and plans that the government had not prepared or trained for, and ultimately, the US government took them with them. He took them with him, calling them his created and trained forces, not because they were being used effectively in Afghanistan's security affairs.|Afghanistan should have a thorough situation analysis based on impartial monitoring and surveys. Based on the analysis results and the situation, aid should be pledged to Afghanistan and transferred to Afghanistan thru Afghanistan's own national budget, and the use of this budget in Afghanistan should be monitored to prevent corruption in its expenditure. In other words, the institution or donor that is cooperating, or the international community itself, should closely monitor how its cooperation is being used. This is how monetary and financial corruption is prevented and a positive change is brought about in the work process.|\n",
    "ID_S2_022|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|A clear example of both states can be found during the Republic era (2011-2021). For example, we can recall Ashraf Ghani's decision to sign a security agreement with the United States, which he stated aimed to prioritize national interests over ethnic interests. Karzai refused to sign the treaty, but Hanif Atmar, the then foreign minister, signed the treaty on behalf of Ashraf Ghani in 2014. After the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the debate over signing a \"Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA)\" with the United States was heated. Hamid Karzai refused to sign it, considering it contrary to national independence. However, at the beginning of the National Unity Government, despite political pressure from various ethnic factions, Ashraf Ghani decided to sign it. Ashraf Ghani stated that the purpose of this action was to ensure the survival of the government structure and security forces, maintain financial aid, and prevent a security vacuum. Many Pashtun-centric figures within the government and Karzai's circle opposed it by signing, but Ghani called it a \"national necessity.\" After signing this agreement, Western financial and military support for the Afghan government continued until 2021, and the Nano mission to assist and equip the national army continued. The signing of this treaty strengthened the international legitimacy of the Afghan government. Although this decision sparked criticism, it was a rare example of prioritizing national interests (in line with the survival of the republican system and the country's security) despite ethnic and political pressures, and it had positive short-term results. It is worth mentioning that Rahmatullah Nabil (former head of national security) also opposed political and ethnic pressures multiple times during his tenure as head of national security (2014-2016) and emphasized strengthening national and non-ethnic structures within the intelligence services. His opposition to the release of some Taliban figures, particularly due to political and ethnic pressures, was a sign of prioritizing national interests over ethnic interests. Nabil's resignation in protest against Ashraf Ghani's personal and discriminatory policies (during his visit to Pakistan) was a sign of his nationalist stance. b) Ethnically biased and exclusionary decisions (2017-2020). During Ashraf Ghani's second term as president, appointments in security institutions – particularly the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the National Directorate of Security – took on a distinctly ethnic flavor. Many commanders and governors were appointed based on the criterion of \"ethnic loyalty,\" regardless of their professional and technical competence. for example, in 2018, Ashraf Ghani appointed General Tariq Shah Bahrami (affiliated with a specific ethnic circle) as Minister of Defense instead of Abdullah Habibi. These changes, along with the gradual removal of Tajik and Uzbek commanders from security structures, sparked strong political reactions in the north of the country. This displacement weakened cohesion within the security forces and widened the gap between the northern forces and the central government. These decisions also undermined trust within the resistance fronts against the Taliban, ultimately leading to the rapid fall of provinces in 2021 as a result of the collapse of the chain of command and lack of coordination among the forces. This type of ethnocentric decision-making was an example of ethnic interests overriding national interests, which led to the weakening of the security structure and the collapse of the republican system. At the end of his second term, instead of strengthening national institutions, Hamid Karzai (President until 2014) strengthened a network of ethnic and local commanders to maintain his ethnic influence in the south of the country. In appointing governors and security officials, he prioritized ethnic balance over merit, and instead of strengthening \"nation-building,\" he pursued a policy of \"ethnic appeasement\" to ensure his political survival. These decisions of his had bad consequences and It rooted the culture of ethnic dealing in the government structure and passed it on to the next government. It then became clear that these Karzai programs were steps toward paving the way for the Taliban, until Ghani completed Karzai's unfinished mission by handing over the Arg to the Taliban. Amrullah Saleh (Ashraf Ghani's first deputy and former national security chief), despite his anti-terrorism and nationalist record, spoke from an ethnic perspective in the final years of his cooperation with Ghani, contributing to the polarization of the political atmosphere. Also, some of his statements and positions on social media, instead of emphasizing \"national convergence,\" sometimes took on an ethnic and linguistic tone. Such positions reduced the capacity for national unity within the anti-Taliban resistance front in the final days of the Republic.|No response|A clear example of this type of project can be explained in Nangarhar province, where the dispute was over water distribution in the Serekan (Spin Ghar) district. Between 2016 and 2019, the dispute between the farmers of two villages over the distribution of water from the \"Kameh\" irrigation canal intensified due to a lack of coordination between the Nangarhar Water Basin Department and local councils. Because the government had changed the canal route without consulting local influentials, local conflicts erupted and agricultural lands remained dry for several months. In contrast, a project in Bamyan province can be mentioned where the dispute over the boundary of agricultural lands in the village of \"Shiber\" (2018-2019) was resolved thru dialog. In this case, close cooperation between the Bamyan Department of Agriculture and local elders led to the establishment of a mediation committee, resolving the dispute peacefully thru dialog.|A specific example of this project was the decision-making process regarding the implementation of the \"TAPI\" project (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline) around the years 2015-2021, with the Asian Development Bank and the government of Turkmenistan as donors. Explanation: The Afghan government, under pressure and encouragement from foreign donors, especially the Asian Development Bank, prioritized the advancement of the TAPI project to be recognized as a regionally supported energy transit route. However, in practice, insecurity along the project route and the lack of guarantyd real benefits for the people of Afghanistan led to national investment in domestic energy infrastructure (such as electricity generation from northern gas or domestic dams) being overlooked. The failure of this project to materialize had negative consequences. This project never materialized, diverting government attention from more urgent domestic projects, increasing Afghanistan's political dependence on regional countries; as a result, Afghanistan's national interests were sacrificed to the geopolitical priorities of the donors.|Aid should be 100% channeled thru the government's national budget and monitored by the local people, not thru separate donor projects. Practical advice: In any post-war reconstruction program, before allocating funds and starting projects, a \"tripartite partnership structure\" must be established between the central government, local institutions, and civil society to ensure joint decision-making on priorities and monitoring of implementation. One successful example of this project was the Citizen Covenant program. In the \"Citizenship Covenant\" program (2016-2020), when village development councils participated in decision-making about small projects (such as roads or schools), the projects were implemented on time and with quality. However, in projects that were planned solely by ministries or foreign donors (such as some World Bank projects in the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development), work either stopped or the quality decreased due to local distrust and administrative corruption. This poor quality of projects will be resolved when they have genuine participation. This showed that without the genuine participation of the people and local leaders in design and monitoring, no foreign aid, even if it amounts to billions of dollars, will be sustainable or used effectively.\n",

My visit, along with that of former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, with the perspective of prioritizing ethnic interests, paved the way in 2021 for the downfall of a legitimate, inclusive government in favor of a specific ethnic group (the Taliban), both of whom are from the same ethnic background (Pashtun). He removed experienced and influential individuals from the ranks of the security forces and civil positions, gradually handed over districts to the Taliban one after another, and finally brought an end to the 20-year Republic with his own escape.|Many international partners were involved in the corruption of high-ranking Afghan officials, and in many cases, they prevented their prosecution by judicial and legal institutions. In my opinion, the hypothesis that widespread corruption was the main obstacle to cooperation between the government and international partners is incorrect. On the contrary, high-ranking government officials and most of their international partners were complicit in widespread corruption, including the law, police, judiciary, prosecution, parliament, and the military. Everything was under the control of this corrupt gang; there was no second authority to hold them accountable, and everyone was in cahoots. I have personally seen dozens of infrastructure projects that, despite consuming huge sums of money, have not lasted due to poor quality and are currently unusable.|One of the main reasons for the lack of institutionalization of laws in Afghanistan's various systems has been these traditional tribal structures, and in many cases, despite the clarity of the law, disputes were resolved by local elders, which often resulted in injustice in the decisions of local councils and tribal elders' assemblies. Traditional and tribal structures have never been supportive of the rule of law in the country; on the contrary, these structures have weakened the law.|Exactly, governments dependent on foreign aid are not independent in their decision-making. For example: The extraction of the Aynak copper mine in Logar province was awarded by the then government to a Chinese company, but due to the disagreements and conflicts between China and Western countries, led by the United States, and because the Chinese company was also the financial backer of the then government, the extraction of this national project was not allowed to be realized, and the government was obliged to follow the policies and guidelines of the United States.|Not all countries are in the same state after a war; some may need to rebuild buildings, roads, bridges, and highways. However, some of these countries may have a serious need and priority for education, promoting the rule of law, strengthening national unity, raising citizens' knowledge levels, avoiding violence, and so on.

The Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Directorate, without consulting the village council and local elders, decided to change the water distribution route in the secondary canal to help the new irrigation project. Local leaders and the local council considered this decision unilateral and contrary to the previous agreement, and prevented its implementation. The government was also unable to implement the decision without local support. Result : The channel remained closed for about two months. Agricultural lands in both villages were dry and damaged. Physical and armed clashes occurred between young people from two villages, and several people were injured. The issue was only temporarily resolved after a joint council was formed between the government and local elders.|It is clear that non-discretionary budgets (foreign aid) have a negative impact on the independent decision-making of government institutions. A specific answer will be provided below. Decision Topic: Increasing the size of security forces beyond the country's financial capacity Time: 2011-2014. Effective Donor: United States and NATO. Area: Security Policy and National Budget. Following the Chicago and Tokyo conferences, international donors, particularly the United States, emphasized the rapid increase in the number of Afghan security forces (army and police) to approximately 352,000 personnel. This decision was based more on NATO's military objectives than on an assessment of Afghanistan's economic and administrative capacity. Why was it against national interests? The Afghan government had warned that the national budget could not afford to pay the salaries, logistics, and maintenance of this number of troops, but accepted the proposal due to its dependence on foreign aid. Negative consequences: Creating strong financial dependence; over 90% of security expenditures were paid for by foreign aid. After aid was reduced in the years 1398-1400, livelihoods and equipping units faced difficulties. Inability to maintain expensive equipment and aircraft that could only be operated by foreign specialists. Decreased morale and the collapse of the command structure in the final months of the regime.|The intervention of the international community should be contingent on non-interference in political and economic decision-making.

    "ID_S2_025|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|: A) In short and concise terms, a decision by a senior Afghan government official that prioritized national interests over ethnic interests, and which had positive results, led the government to decide in the years 2011-2021 to implement the important infrastructure project of constructing a major highway that begins at the Kabul axis and ends in Bamyan and Daikundi, as well as along the Baghlan route, which connects the aforementioned provinces to the center of Kabul, based on national priorities. Despite political and ethnic pressures to divert funds to specific routes and regions, the project was implemented in accordance with public needs and national interests. The importance of this project was that it connected several central and northern provinces of Afghanistan with each other and with the capital. Result: - Transportation routes and the movement of merchants' goods between the aforementioned provinces were facilitated, and costs were reduced. - Public satisfaction increased, and people's trust in the government and the ruling system grew. - This project was one of the national projects in the decade (2010-2020) that was implemented regardless of ethnic affiliation. - The connection of the Herat, Badghis, Faryab, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Ghazni routes, where people from the mentioned regions live with different ethnicities and languages, has connected their network, which demonstrates effective leadership free from ethnic interests. - Result: Positive, and its consequences: - Connecting important central, northern, and western provinces, reducing travel costs and facilitating travel for passengers, transporting goods, and increasing trade between provinces. - Widespread public satisfaction and increased trust between the people of the provinces and the center emerged. -Note: If you wish, you can also consider the road network and the connection of the Bamyan, Yakawlang-Kotel-e Qonaq-Nili (the center of Daikundi) and Jaghori routes as part of this large national network. B) Making a decision that was influenced by ethnic bias and had an unsuccessful and ineffective outcome: During the period 2011-2021, actions and measures were taken in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health based on ethnic tendencies, network affiliation, and group affiliation, which: - In the Ministry of Education and Health, appointments and placements of individuals in key positions were made based on ethnic and group affiliation, while specialized and experienced staff were sidelined and individuals lacking experience and expertise were appointed to important and key positions. - In the years 2016-2018, official reports from Faryab, Paktia, Logar, and Takhar provinces showed that: - School construction and textbook printing projects were delayed due to poor management and corruption. - The books were not distributed on time. - Corruption in contracts increased. - Some donor-funded projects were canceled. - This is a clear example of decision-making failure influenced by bias.|Widespread corruption clearly had negative effects on international projects. There are specific examples of projects being delayed due to corruption. The National Rural Water Supply Program project in Uruzgan and Helmand provinces from 2014-2016, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in collaboration with the World Bank, carried out rural water supply projects. According to information (reports) from Uruzgan and Helmand: - Local contractors embezzled part of the budget. - The drilling quality was unsatisfactory, and the water tank preparation was of poor quality. - The financial documents lacked transparency. Result: The World Bank halted the project for several months, and thousands of families were left without access to clean water. Reduced service quality: Health programs in the Ministry of Public Health, in 2017, in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, and Farah, reported that health implementing companies had illegally withdrawn a portion of the budget, which resulted in: - Clinics were left without medicine or medical supplies. - Employe salaries haven't been paid for months. - Maternal and child mortality increased, and the quality of health service delivery severely declined and even collapsed. - Cutting off foreign aid due to corruption: The printing and publication of textbooks in the Ministry of Education in 1397 (solar year) was supported by international donors, especially the European Union. After the exposure of corruption in the printing and publication contracts for hundreds of thousands of textbooks for education students, the following decisions were made: - They completely cut off the budget that had been allocated. - The project's execution was halted pending complete reviews. - Millions of students were unable to receive books in the next academic year. - The Ministry of Education's credibility was questioned and the level of trust in it decreased significantly.|The effects of the gap between formal and traditional institutions. There are clear examples where projects have faced difficulties in implementation due to poor cooperation between formal and traditional institutions. In Baghlan Province - Burka District: Problems and conflicts over the distribution of irrigation canal water in 2015. Without coordinating or consulting with local elders, the government implemented a new water distribution plan. This action resulted in: - Two villages entered into conflict and dispute. - Several acres of land were destroyed. - The canal improvement project was halted for several months. Matters that have been resolved correctly and effectively due to effective cooperation between formal and traditional institutions: In Herat Province, Injil District: Problems and disputes arose between the two families (tribes) regarding irrigated lands. To resolve this issue, the government, in collaboration with the local council, the tribal jirga, the land authorities, held joint meetings and sessions, which resulted in: - The conflict was resolved non-violently. - The land was officially registered by the government. - The irrigation project that was beyond was implemented without any problems.|How foreign aid affects the government's independent decision-making. A) Supportive effects on government decision-making: In the years 2011-2016, the United States and NATO insisted and emphasized the implementation of development budgets in the security sector. Donors insisted that more budget be spent on creating security forces, building bases, and equipping the police. The government was forced to: - Transfer a large portion of development budget from economic and infrastructure projects to security-focused (security) projects. B) Negative consequences and repercussions (contrary to national interests) that resulted in the following: - Economic projects (road construction, energy, agriculture) were underfunded and poorly developed. - The level of economic growth decreased and slowed down. - The country's dependence on foreign aid increased. - It created public dissatisfaction with the lack of development services.|Practical recommendations for the future (Framework for assistance) Based on the lessons learned over the years and real-world experience in Afghan society, how should it be and what should be done? Based on past experiences, it is suggested that international aid to Afghanistan (a post-conflict country) be implemented in a hybrid model. How? - 50% of the aid will be implemented and operationalized thru the national government budget, under the supervision of an independent body, civil society councils, and the media. - 50% of the aid will be implemented thru independent donor projects to reduce the risks of politicization and corruption. Perhaps we can find an example of this model in the Citizen Contract Program (CCNPP), where local community monitoring led to greater transparency and trust.

    "ID_S1_004|10/25/2025 4:19:02|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|2016–2021|After 2001, it was essential for any Afghan leader to enjoy comprehensive rule and strategic legitimacy. First, comprehensive rule was necessary to pursue the unification of Afghanistan's religions, ethnicities, and tribes into a single state and national identity. Years of violent conflict had torn apart the fabric of Afghan society, and almost everywhere in Afghanistan, the risk of destruction from political unrest was higher than usual. Only through leadership that embraces power sharing and representation can Afghanistan hope to achieve a certain level of political stability and social cohesion. Second, as much as reestablishing state authority will be part of the maturation of the Afghan state, strategic legitimacy locally, regionally, and globally will be fundamental to this transformation. Domestic legitimacy has been based on two main objectives: responding to citizens' needs and providing a minimum level of services, and respecting Islamic and traditional values, which are also important elements of domestic legitimacy. Restoring international legitimacy and gaining a certain level of diplomatic credibility requires some ability to counter foreign influence and address negative perceptions of living under the tutelage of external actors and their sovereign powers. Without a legitimate foundation, any government risks being seen as an external power transfer, and the absence of legitimacy undermines any progress toward long-term stability.|Afghan leaders have made progress, but they also have to deal with ongoing challenges in bringing together formal government institutions and traditional institutions like the Loya Jirga and local councils. Programs such as the Loya Jirga and the National Solidarity Program have involved local leaders in some decision-making and development initiatives, although they have not always been effective. In many locations, local loyalties, instability, and lack of government capacity have made it difficult to fully integrate these systems.|Heavy reliance on foreign funding and technical assistance hampered the development of self-reliant and accountable strategic thinking among Afghan leaders, as donors predetermined or influenced a large portion of the budget and major projects. As a result, leaders generally felt compelled to prioritize donor commitments over national priorities. This, in turn, fostered a dependency mindset that stifled initiative and weakened local accountability, as success came to be defined more by satisfying foreign partners than by addressing the realities faced by Afghan citizens.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Neutral|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Neutral|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|Aside from the financial situation, the significant weakness affecting service delivery and policy implementation was the limited capability and expertise in government institutions. Many ministries and local offices did not have qualified staff, systems, or coordination, which ultimately created significant obstacles to mobilize plans into action. This affected timeliness, productivity, and public frustrations across all sectors, including health, education, and infrastructure. |Inability to provide security|An example is Afghanistan's National Solidarity Program (NSP), which empowered people at the community level through Community Development Councils. By engaging with local elders and taking into account customary decision-making processes, the program was culturally appropriate and unearthed community priorities delivering educational, transportation, and water infrastructure. Conversely, programs that did not respect cultural contexts were likely to be rejected by communities, underscoring the critical importance of cultural appropriateness in programming.|The key takeaway from 2001-2021 is that effective and acceptable governance is not created just from external funding or external institutions; it has to be central to local political reality and social trust. In Afghanistan, efforts were primarily centered on creating a formal structure and the institution needed to satisfy donor expectations, yet when institutions lacked legitimacy to traditional leadership, customary practices, and citizen need, they were often presented an illusion of legitimacy. Sustainable governance requires a balance between contemporary state institutions and local authority, security, the provision of basic services, and accountability grounded in the people themselves.|Not provided\n",

In addition, he should have the ability to build national consensus and trust among active political institutions, local and customary structures, civil society, and international partners so that his decisions are implemented with broad national support.|The traditional structure has always been preferred; even the formal institution was managed with a traditional perspective, so we conclude that the link between these two institutions was the dominance of tradition over the formal structure.|Heavy reliance on foreign aid has led to a decline in nationalism, weakened local government accountability, and discouraged independent strategic thinking.

This problem led to overlapping tasks, parallel work, lack of accountability, and failure to implement policies at the national level, resulting in services not reaching citizens effectively even when resources were available.|Widespread corruption|A notable example of this is the land registration reform program. Designed to promote transparency and reduce land disputes, the program failed to deliver positive results in many areas due to poor coordination with social structures and local values, such as the role of jirga councils and people's trust in local mediation. People continued to view local solutions as more credible and fair than resorting to official channels.|The most important lesson of this course is that effective and legitimate governance is sustainable when its political and social ownership arises from within the society, not imposed from without. In a country like Afghanistan, legitimacy does not come from the ballot box or international support alone; it requires internal consensus, coherence with the cultural and social context, transparency, and genuine participation of the people in decision-making. Governance is strengthened when formal state structures, local community values, and traditional institutions are connected; stability and legitimacy are undermined when this connection is ignored.|Yes! An important point that has been less addressed is the importance of institutional continuity in the process of state-building in Afghanistan. Experience has shown that extensive, accelerated, and person-centered changes in leadership, diplomacy, and government structures have caused no policy or program to survive. In the absence of continuity, capacities were not accumulated, historical memory was not formed, and each government effectively started from scratch. In my opinion, if policies and institutions had structural stability, a culture of accountability, and a program-centered approach, many domestic and international efforts in the path of state-building in Afghanistan would have had more lasting and effective results.\n",

For example, the success of some local governors in development projects, such as improving water supply systems in villages, was due to their understanding of the needs of the people and their interaction with traditional leaders, while similar projects failed in areas with leaders who were less experienced or unfamiliar with the local culture.\n",
    "ID_S1_012|10/26/2025 17:36:30|Former Afghan Government Official|2011–2015, 2016–2021|In my opinion, given Afghanistan's unique characteristics, not only over the past 20 years but also in the future, an effective leader can only be effective if, as a first step, they have a cross-ethnic vision for the country and consider Afghanistan to be connected to and dependent on all of its ethnic groups. Second, they must be specialized. To overcome and properly manage the crisis, they must assemble a team of experts to organize matters with complete competence, experience, and understanding. In short, a cross-ethnic vision and a specialized, experience-centered vision are essential characteristics of an effective leader in Afghanistan.|Afghan leaders managed to build relationships between official institutions and traditional structures to some extent, but this balance was unstable. For example, during the reigns of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, the Loya Jirga councils were used for national decision-making, but no sustainable coordination with government institutions was established.|Unfortunately, Afghanistan was completely dependent on aid from the international community, and this total dependence meant that, in times of crisis and decision-making, the country's leaders were unable to make independent decisions based on the national interests of the country. As a result, the outcome and repercussions of this situation were exactly what the United States wanted.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Widespread corruption|I disagree with the lack of financial resources. Well, if we take that into account, in addition to that, the prevalence of corruption and the appointment of individuals based on connections rather than qualifications were important factors in the poor delivery of services and the failure to implement policies.|Widespread corruption|The most prominent example I can give is the country's master plan for electricity, which the country's leaders changed against the interests of the Afghan people due to ethnic biases, leaving Afghanistan in darkness to this day. It is a very detailed story that cannot be described here.|I think the biggest lesson that can be learned is that if a country like Afghanistan wants to emerge from the crisis, they must be careful in choosing and appointing their leaders, they must vote for people who will work for Afghanistan, and in the second step, the priority of the leaders and all the people should be the collective interests of the country. We voted based on ethnic affiliations, the leaders decided based on their ethnic affiliations, and the result was that the country became more critical. The big lesson is to appoint people based on their competence, honesty, and expertise, not ethnic affiliations, language, etc. In short, post-conflict countries need competent and honest people who prioritize the interests of the country above everything else.|While recalling the issues mentioned above, the most important issue that is vital for Afghanistan is governance away from emotions; over the past few decades, we have tried to turn the country into a battlefield and a conflict between neighbors with emotional policies. Afghanistan will not develop unless a neighbor called Pakistan feels at ease with us. Strategic wisdom dictates that we observe moderation in our relations between India and Pakistan to protect ourselves from possible harm from Pakistan, which we have unfortunately not done so far.\n",
    "ID_S1_013|10/26/2025 17:42:03|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|2011–2015|In my opinion, the two most important qualities for an effective Afghan leader after 2001 were: 1. The ability to build national unity: After years of war and ethnic conflict, an effective leader must be able to build trust and solidarity among different groups, ethnicities, and religions in order to lay the foundations for a sustainable nation-state. 2. Commitment to transparency and fighting corruption: During the reconstruction period in Afghanistan, rampant corruption was one of the main challenges. A leader who emphasizes transparency, accountability, and justice is able to maintain the trust of the people and the international community and make the development process sustainable.|Unfortunately, customs and traditions still prevail in many parts of the country, and tribal values are paramount. On the other hand, during the 20-year republic, some outsiders did not believe in these customs and traditions, and some even showed an excessive desire to use them to polish their image in front of the public by respecting customs and traditions. In my opinion, the result of these trends was a more critical situation in the country. We have multifaceted crises and problems in the country that must be solved with modern science, a specialized perspective, and effective diplomacy, or at least a reasonable solution must be found for them. However, not only did we lack a logical and specialized perspective in this area, but we also wanted to solve the country's most sensitive problems through the Loya Jirga, a council whose members are mostly illiterate or have limited education. In fact, the country's constitution stipulates that the constitution can be amended through the Loya Jirga, although it has its own procedures. In my opinion, after 2001, Afghan leaders were only able to build effective bridges between official state institutions and traditional structures, such as local councils and jirgas, to a limited extent. On the one hand, attempts were made to use traditional structures in decision-making. For example, the 2003 Constitutional Loya Jirga, the Consultative Peace Jirga, and the Jirga for the Release of Taliban Prisoners in subsequent years were examples of using local traditions to legitimize national decisions. These councils helped people feel that they had a stake in the political process. On the other hand, in many cases, a gap remained between the central government and local structures. The government failed to integrate these traditional institutions into the formal system in a sustainable manner. As a result, government decisions were sometimes met with opposition or mistrust at the local level. In short, attempts were made to build links, but these links were not sustainable or institutionalized, and one of the main weaknesses in the Afghan state-building process remained.|Overreliance on international financial and technical assistance has had profound effects on the development of independent strategic thinking among Afghan leaders. On the one hand, this reliance has led to the country's overall planning and decision-making being influenced by the priorities, policies, and interests of donor countries, rather than the real needs of Afghan society. As a result, many leaders focused on attracting foreign support to seize power and manage aid resources, rather than on developing sustainable national strategies. On the other hand, this situation has weakened the culture of domestic accountability; when budgets and resources are mainly provided from abroad, leaders feel less pressure to be accountable to the people. In other words, they derived their legitimacy more from international support than from public satisfaction. As a result, excessive reliance on foreign aid has hindered the growth of intellectual independence, institutional self-sufficiency, and political accountability among the Afghan leadership.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not very effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, rampant corruption, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|In addition to a lack of financial resources, one of the most notable internal weaknesses of Afghan state institutions was their lack of effective administrative and organizational capacities, coupled with rampant corruption.

As a result, a culture of national planning did not flourish, and sustainable planning policies often remained unstable and dependent on external actors, leading to extremely negative and poor outcomes.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not very effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, rampant corruption, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|\"The shortcomings and weaknesses within the government were identified as follows: - The Afghan government had a transparent system for hiring, selecting, and promoting individuals based on political, ethnic, and religious ties, and merit was not taken into account in the hiring and promotion process.\n",

    "The plan and program for reforming the justice and judicial system, which aimed to build a modern justice system based on international standards, unfortunately did not align with the traditional values and structures of our society in practice.

This path, and the continued parallel operation of the formal and traditional justice systems, led to a lack of trust among the people.\n",

Experiences have shown that institutions were considered based on the culture and social structures and the real needs of the society, and gradual reforms were carried out, and the participation and trust of the people were attracted and absorbed. Therefore, effective and sustainable governance cannot be formed based on external models and from outside. Such a structure that does not have a participatory role and the trust of the people will last and be sustainable.|Unfortunately, after 2001, political leadership was in the hands of traditional and warlike figures.

Be serious about implementing and enforcing the rule of law.|Informal institutions in Afghanistan have historically been important for resolving issues. Leaders and government officials have attempted to use this method to make decisions that address the country's best interests. However, in modern governance, non-traditional institutions that are not formed on the basis of a social contract do not have sufficient authority and credibility to make major decisions at the national level. Leaders or political elites in Afghanistan, who were in fact the traditional leaders of society, believed in this method as a solution to major national problems. Before the Taliban came to power, Afghan governments often turned to consultative jirga councils to resolve national issues and even make decisions affecting their foreign policy. One of the clearest examples of this issue is the release of 400 Taliban prisoners from the prisons of the legitimate Afghan government in 2020 through the \"Peace Council or Consultative Meeting.\"|Over-reliance on international resources has prevented political leaders from paying attention to and thinking about local resources.

Second, he must be honest and accountable to his people—a leader who stands with his people, leads them through their pain, grief, and hopes, and leads them with honesty.|He believes that Afghan leaders have many ways to build an effective relationship between formal government institutions and traditional communities and structures. Most of the time, both systems were in a state of distrust. The executive branch of the high command spent a lot of time on energy, which was important to him. On the other hand, traditional and tribal councils are crowded with government officials, have elders who do not trust them, and are rife with political corruption. In addition, traditional and local councils are more isolated from the armed forces and the opposition. Some political leaders have tried, but unfortunately, their symbolic efforts have been short-lived. In the case of the Loya Jirga, a local jirga was formed, the debate was managed, and everything was symbolic of his policies. Overall, this relationship remained incomplete—neither traditional structures, nor formal government institutions, nor the trust of the people were strengthened.|I believe that the country has relied too heavily on foreign political leaders and financial and technical assistance, which has weakened Afghan leaders' sense of national responsibility and independent strategic thinking. When equipment is the last important part of the organization, we can clearly see how weak mid-level government managers are, as well as their independence, strategic thinking, and responsibility. The sense of ownership of the country and the government has been seriously damaged, and the country has become heavily dependent on foreigners and their financial and technical assistance. After 2016, many leaders tried to reduce dependence on the homeland and restore responsibility. Remember some examples. For example, in 2016, Americans seriously discussed strengthening the country's air force. Similarly, we have only 157 Black Hawk helicopters. The air force has received dozens of transport and large military equipment, giant fighter jets, fighter jets, and bombers. Every six months, dozens of young people in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Europe, and the United States receive training in the Air Force. For example, when the former president seriously discussed the Case Management System (CMS), he took the matter to the US Supreme Court. In front of millions of American citizens, biometric data and its transfer were discussed, the nationality of topographic information was discussed, security responsibilities were transferred, and he also had a lot of work under his control, but he did his best, did not feel ownership, relied on foreign countries, and ultimately paved the way for the fall.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|I believe that the most serious impact is weak internal institutions, corruption, political interference, and weak capacity (capacity gap).

The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) launched the Afghan National Integration Program around 2003 with the help of the World Bank. This program aims to empower villagers to make decisions and develop and implement projects. De Biera's factors: 1. Social values of harmony: The Afghan Rural Council Program, the Jirga Council, and the Partnership should be established. The villagers chose the Shura Council (Village Development Council) and decided to implement the project (road, water, school, bridge, electricity, etc.). 2. Trust and sense of ownership among the people: When the people participated in decision-making, they felt that they were managing the project themselves, not the government or foreigners. Corruption became more difficult. 3. Gradual participation of women: In areas where traditional restrictions exist, the structure of women's councils should be introduced gradually and cautiously. Da Franji prevented conflict and paved the way for Kibledo. The result: more than 35,000 projects benefited from the National Solidarity Program, and thousands of small development projects improved people's lives. The Community Development Program of the World Bank and other institutions is a successful example.

This leader must have strategic leadership and the ability to make decisive decisions in order to pursue a clear strategy for the country's stability, security, and long-term economic growth. A close relationship with the people and a deep understanding of the nation's needs and values are also essential for a leader, as the trust of the people is the foundation of any legitimate system. In addition, the leader of international relations must have the ability to manage effectively, so that the national interests of Afghanistan and its international partners are protected in a balanced manner.|After 2001, the Afghan government leadership faced political and administrative complexities in achieving an effective balance between formal institutions and traditional community structures, namely jirgas and local councils. The political and social reality in Afghanistan shows that traditional structures of legitimacy, arbitration, and social order are based on historical provisions, while formal government institutions represent modern governance, accountability, and the rule of law. Although some leaders have attempted to integrate the two by establishing consultative councils, these efforts have often failed to achieve effective coordination and long-term action. For example, the adoption of the Loya Jirga constitution and the participation of the people is a symbolic example, and the decision itself has not been fully implemented at the political or administrative level of the Loya government. Overall, the efforts of Afghan leaders and formal and informal institutions to build an effective bridge have been limited because they do not appreciate traditions and structures. This should be recognized as an authentic form, not only in modern state-building, but also in line with the principles of a sustainable framework.|His analysis, leadership of Afghanistan, international financial and technical assistance, and heavy reliance on independent strategic thinking and responsiveness had a profound impact on the institution. This dependence has often forced leaders to follow the requirements and conditions of international donors, limiting their ability to make independent, long-term policy decisions. It will also weaken the culture of accountability, because decisions about responsibility and accountability will, in most cases, depend on foreign institutions and their expectations. In addition, reliance on foreign aid has also limited local innovation, capacity building, and national resources based on decision-making capacity, damaging the government's legitimacy and public confidence.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|In addition to limited financial resources, limited human and administrative capacity in Afghan government institutions is one of the biggest internal obstacles that has had a profound impact on service delivery and policy implementation. Many institutions lack sufficient professional staff, administrative skills, and technical skills, limiting their ability to effectively meet the needs of the people. In addition, deficiencies in internal organizational structures, centralized decision-making, high centralization, lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms, and weak inter-agency coordination have prevented the effective implementation of policies. Overall, this internal weakness has not only led to a decline in service quality, but has also created a series of challenges in promoting government legitimacy and public trust, requiring a comprehensive strategic plan for future policymaking and government reforms.|Inability to provide security and rampant corruption|Afghanistan's Women's Rights Development Program, which is an important effort in governance and social reforms after 2001, can be presented as an important example that people have experienced both success and failure with social and cultural values.

In addition, local leaders, communities, and cultural sensitivities take into account the lack of diplomatic efforts and international cooperation and influence.

At that time, Afghanistan was facing serious economic problems, such as energy shortages and restrictions on regional trade. Ashraf Ghani emphasized the priority of national interests and considered the overall interests of the country to be superior to ethnic or regional interests. He actively participated in international negotiations, signed relevant agreements, and approved the necessary internal measures for pipeline construction, such as land use and route selection. Although the project is not yet complete, Ghani's decision has paved the way for the expansion of regional economic cooperation and the creation of job opportunities for the people of Afghanistan, and has given the country international economic credibility. This is an example where national interests took precedence over ethnic interests and had positive outcomes.|Direct experience from a road construction project in Parwan province in 2017 showed how administrative and financial corruption hinders coordination. During the implementation of the contracts for this project, some contracting companies did not properly adhere to road construction standards, and in some sections, only a thin layer of sand was used. According to reports from local people and the press, the project delays and poor road quality were linked to corruption, as contracts were often awarded in the names of influential individuals. As a result, not only was the road quality poor, but coordination between government agencies and international partners was also slow, and service delivery to local people was affected. This example illustrates how corruption can have a serious negative impact on project implementation, service quality, and the coordination system.|A long-standing water distribution problem in Laghman province of Afghanistan has worsened due to poor cooperation between official institutions and local leaders. The provincial Department of Agriculture tried to start the construction project of a canal, but a place for consultation with the local jirgas and councils was not selected.

The government agencies relied solely on administrative orders, without providing opportunities for trust and participation to local leaders. The outcome was that the project was delayed, water distribution conflicts increased, and public dissatisfaction grew. This example illustrates that coordination between formal and traditional structures plays a vital role in resolving local conflicts.|The police building program in Afghanistan is an example where foreign aid had a negative impact against national interests. A lot of money was spent by international donors to fund and equip the police, but not enough attention was given to managing and building the capacity of the Afghan government's security sector. This process weakened the Afghan government's sovereignty and was driven solely by foreign priorities, not based on Afghanistan's long-term security needs. As a result, there was an increase in police corruption and a weakening of the government system, which had consequences against national interests.|A practical recommendation for Afghanistan's reconstruction is that the international community should implement each aid project thru Afghanistan's national budget and national institutions, rather than having different projects managed by separate donors. This not only prevents the waste of resources but also helps strengthen the country's governmental capacities. A joint fund should be established for aid, with financial oversight and management thru the Ministry of Finance, and project monitoring given to representatives of the community and government. Project implementation should be based on the consultation and participation of local people to ensure their needs are met correctly and to increase project effectiveness. To this end, the transparency of all projects and the monitoring of results should be done thru financial and non-financial audits.

If a joint council had been formed, the conflict would have been easily resolved.|Impact of foreign aid on strategic autonomy Example: A large portion of the security budget and projects were allocated based on the priorities of foreign donors. This focus was on short-term projects and contractual processes, rather than on national capacity building. Pailley: The government's financial independence decreased and long-term stability was harmed.|Practical recommendation for the future Recommendation: A \"national transparent fund\" should be established for aid, with all financial assistance spent thru the government's national budget, but under the supervision of local representatives and observers.

Logic: This eliminates the parallel approach to aid, strengthens government capacity, and provides guaranties of transparency and accountability.\n",
    "ID_S2_009|International Diplomat/Representative of an International Organization|Regarding the transnational leader: In 2020, I was working at the Ministry of Water and Energy as the Director of Water Affairs Regulation for the General Directorate of the Kabul River Basin. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, initiated a move to divide the Ministry of Water and Energy into two agencies: the National Water Affairs Regulatory Authority and the National Energy Affairs Regulatory Authority. From an administrative perspective, this was a positive and national act because Afghanistan produces approximately 75 billion cubic meters of water annually but is unable to utilize 20% of this total due to mismanagement. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a single agency for comprehensive management of water resources to control Afghanistan's water resources thru a strategic plan spanning approximately 5 years and 10 years. Part A: This was a positive step toward economic growth for the country, improving agriculture from the water infrastructure. Part B: This action by the president failed because the president had ethnic and personal motives for two reasons. First, he turned the ministry into an administration because he wanted to be allowed by the constitution to appoint anyone to head an administration without needing a vote from parliament to elect them. Secondly, according to the agreements of the unity government, the Ministry of Water and Energy belonged to Dr. Abdullah. How could he have his close associates in this ministry when he had turned the ministry into a management?|Corruption as an obstacle to coordination, there were two reasons for the president to carry out widespread corruption. First, he appointed someone close to him to head the administration, and thru this, he was able to implement the infrastructure projects for the imaginary water facilities and add their cost to his capital, which he almost did. Or, he contracted and implemented the infrastructure projects for the water facilities with several companies that were from his own people, and he did. I witnessed several projects; a small example of this was the maintenance and care of the Darunta Dam, which cost approximately 53 million Afghanis. This project was contracted by a company from his own people, and it can be said that this project was contracted for 25 million. Secondly, according to the law, the head of the administration was appointed by the president, and this head of the administration was accountable and reported to no one other than the president. Even Parliament, the embodiment of the people's will, did not have the authority to remove or hold them accountable.|Regarding the gap between the formal and dominant institutions, I must say that since the ministries and departments were restructured, the president, according to the constitution, had the authority to choose the head of the department himself. Parliament, which represented the people, had no vote or authority in this process. For this reason, a person close to power or with political influence was usually appointed to head the departments, rather than technical and expert individuals. The person who was appointed only reported to the president and was not accountable to any other institution. For example, in the Surkh Rod district of Nangarhar province (the Sultanpur area), a project to build a protective wall was implemented. I don't remember the exact cost, but it was very high. This project was approved thru the Ministry of Energy and Water at the time. The wall was supposed to be two and a half meters high below ground, hidden from public view, but it was only built to a height of about one and a half meters; another meter remained incomplete, and unsuitable materials were used. When the flood came, the wall collapsed and caused extensive damage to people's land. People complained, but because the head of the department and his close associates were involved at the top of the project, no one dared to follow up. The implementing company was also owned by the head of the department himself and was mostly selected based on ethnic ties. At that time, such disputes were unsolvable because when the project is the government itself and the government's power is behind it, the people have no way to resist. As a result, the problem remained unresolved and no authority had the jurisdiction to investigate.|At the National Water Resources Management Authority where I worked, foreign aid played a very effective role. No independent decisions were made; most projects were funded thru the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and the implementation of the projects depended on these resources. When the Ministry of Energy and Water was transformed into the National Water Regulatory Authority, a new problem arose: the authority was no longer accountable to parliament because its head was appointed by the president and only reported to him. There was no regulatory authority (except for the president himself). For this reason, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank stopped their aid. They said, \"We will not give money to an office that is not accountable and cannot be questioned.\" While the minister was approved by parliament and accountable to the people when the ministry existed. However, the administration lacked such legitimacy, which is why many of the projects that were in the plan were not implemented and remained unfinished.|Based on my experience with the reconstruction situation in Afghanistan, if the international community wants to intervene in post-war countries, it should provide aid thru non-governmental and international organizations (NGOs), not directly thru the government. Because when aid is channeled thru the government, there is usually nepotism, ethnic discrimination, and widespread corruption. The minister gives orders to his close associates, they pass them on to their employes, and the result is that the budget doesn't reach the real people. But in the international model: • A donor entity provides the funds, and a specific institution implements the project. • The second body independently (directly or indirectly) monitors whether the aid has reached the intended recipients. • Separate oversight reduces corruption and increases transparency. For this reason, if aid is provided thru international organizations and strong monitoring teams are in place, no one can act against global standards and people will benefit more from the results.\n",

People protested because they said the watercourse passed thru their land and their rights were being ignored. Because government officials did not cooperate with local elders and guilds, tensions escalated and the project was halted for several months. The lack of cooperation between the government and traditional structures caused delays in the project and led to public distrust.|From 2017 to 2020, several development projects in road construction and water supply were implemented in Daikundi province by USAID and UNOPS. Foreign donors themselves determined the routes, companies, and even the type of building materials, without sufficient coordination with the local administration or the people. Local officials suggested the road route pass thru more populated areas so more people could benefit, but because the final decision was made at the Kabul headquarters with the input of foreign consultants, the less beneficial route was chosen. The project was implemented at a high cost but with less benefit.|Afghanistan's experience shows that when decisions are made without consulting the people, transparency, and a national perspective, the outcome is usually failure; whether in ethnic decisions, government and administrative discussions, or projects implemented under foreign influence. Therefore, in any future international intervention, the aid framework should revolve around a few principles: first, national ownership – decisions should be made domestically, with the leadership of the government and local people, not in foreign offices, and not with the ethnic bias of past governments. Second, accountability and transparency – all projects must be implemented thru the national budget to enable monitoring and accountability. Third, public consultation – local councils and community elders should be involved in project design and monitoring from the outset to prevent ethnic and social conflicts. And in the financial resources section, there needs to be very close monitoring and auditing to prevent financial corruption.\n",
    "ID_S2_011|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|About transnational leadership during the National Unity Government or the Republic from 2014-2020 is that the appointment of governors and heads of departments in Ghor was often based on ethnic affiliation and political pressure, not on merit. In several cases, individuals close to specific ethnic factions were appointed to head local departments such as Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Education, and Health. The result was increased ethnic competition between Tajiks, Hazaras, and Pashtuns within the administration, reduced coordination between institutions, many development projects remained unfinished, people lost trust in the administration, and social divisions widened.|Corruption as an obstacle to the coordination of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development's development projects, especially water supply and road construction projects in the province's districts. Contract companies were selected thru the mediation of some local officials, and a large portion of the project budget was embezzled.

As a result, donors like USAID and UNDP halted a portion of the funding, and project implementation was delayed for several years. Local people lost trust in government institutions.|The gap between the formal and traditional institutions of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, which implemented an irrigation project without consulting local jirgas.

Several months later, negotiations were resumed with the mediation of tribal elders, but government institutions had already lost their credibility.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic governance in adapting aid projects, particularly in the health and education sectors, which were funded by foreign entities such as USAID and the World Bank. Decision-making regarding priorities and budget was primarily done in Kabul and by foreign entities, without considering the actual needs of the people. Health centers were built in a few districts of the province, but permanent human resources and budget were not provided for them. The projects were seemingly completed but closed down after a few months. This dependence on external decisions made the local government feel powerless to manage independently.|Practical recommendations for the future based on my personal experiences. Aid should be managed and monitored thru local councils, namely Jirgas and Development Councils, not just from Kabul or foreign institutions. Local people should have a direct role in all stages, from planning to consumption. The reason is that in projects where the people of Ghor were involved in decision-making, such as some national solidarity and citizenship programs, there was less corruption and the work was actually completed. However, in projects where decisions were made in Kabul or by foreigners, more funds were wasted and there was no accountability.\n",

A local institution must be involved beforehand. One of the failures in the reconstruction of Afghanistan was the focus on institutions and organizations in Kabul, while neglecting local needs. Many projects were designed without consulting local people, which did not address their needs, and there was also a lack of transparency in project implementation. The creation of local councils led to people feeling a sense of ownership, and the decision was correct, with satisfactory results.

Mr. Fazli had studied nursing and did not have the understanding and knowledge of a large and important structure like the Presidential Affairs Department. Their selection was based on ethnicity and proximity to Ghani.|Aid and funding organizations for Afghan projects have always complained about corruption within the structures and were well aware of its widespread presence.

    "ID_S2_016|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|During the rule of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan under Presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, senior officials served who prioritized national interests over ethnic, partisan, and religious interests. A prime example of this could be the extension of the security agreement between the Afghan government and NATO, which resulted in national security and national interests being guarantyd for a specific period. In contrast, a limited number of party leaders working within the government structure prioritized ethnic interests over national interests, and their ethnic policies widened divisions among the people, ultimately undermining national unity. Political parties active in Afghanistan were operating with an expanding ethnic agenda to attract supporters and win elections. Parties should not have considered ethnic, regional, linguistic, religious, or other factors that harm national interests and unity as criteria for their activities. As a result, division among the people increased and hopes for a bright future diminished. Afghanistan's credibility with the international community diminished and international aid was limited. Because most of these aids were misused by these individuals, and the path to Afghanistan's growth and development was challenged.|One sector that did not yield positive results due to widespread administrative corruption was Afghanistan's education sector. Due to the existence of ghost schools and teachers, most of the government's money and budget was embezzled by ministers and senior officials. Cases of administrative corruption in Afghan courts speak to the widespread corruption and lack of transparency. International aid, without effective accountability from ministry leaders, led to delays in the delivery of international assistance and a decline in the quality of education in the country.|International aid provided to Afghanistan should have been implemented in full coordination with the local people thru beneficial projects. Most areas of Afghanistan lack access to safe water, and projects implemented by international NGOs like DACAAR to improve access to safe water often faced implementation difficulties due to local conflicts. Every village or location wanted to implement these projects in their areas, but due to budget constraints, it was difficult for the aid received to reach all vulnerable areas. In many cases, local people prevented the implementation of foreign projects due to security concerns and the activities of armed opponents in their areas. In some cases, these issues were resolved in coordination with local CDC councils, and the local people provided specific conditions to allow these projects to be adapted. For example, the water supply project in Badakhshan and Kunar provinces, which were insecure and had limited access to the government, was implemented with the advice and coordination of local councils because these were humanitarian aid and did not pursue political goals, so the local people allowed the implementation. In conflict-ridden areas, there are widespread disputes over water sources, including the legal ownership of these water resources, which is contested by local people. This has caused project implementation to be delayed or halted.|On the one hand, foreign aid played a very important and vital role for the Afghan government and people in the post-civil war period. However, most of this aid was implemented without oversight and at the discretion of the donor countries, and the Afghan people were unaware of the amount of this aid and how it was spent. Civil activists have mostly expressed their concern that the lack of transparency in the use of domestic budgets and international aid undermines the effectiveness of these contributions. In some cases, donor countries often prioritized their national interests over foreign aid. For example, the aid provided by the Iranian government to the office of Hamid Karzai's government was due to American political and military competition, and they demanded their interests in return for this aid from the Afghan government. The aid that the Indian government continued to provide for the development of Afghanistan was aimed at weakening Pakistan's regional role in the Afghan issue. These factors, which exacerbated regional conflict and competition with neighboring countries, ultimately had a significant impact on national interests and security.|The main recommendation for improving international aid delivery by the global community is to provide transparent mechanisms for implementing these projects so that accountability for these projects is clear to the people. This aid should be under the direct supervision of the people, and the basic priorities of the people should be considered in the preparation of development plans. Afghanistan is in dire need of international aid. Afghanistan is not a poor country and is not in dire need of international aid. The government cannot handle this humanitarian crisis alone, and the international community must continue its assistance. Foreign aid provided by international aid organizations did not reduce poverty in the country due to a lack of transparency, and public distrust of this aid increased. Afghanistan is still an economically weak country, and according to international statistics, Afghanistan faces a harsh winter, making a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan still possible. In order for foreign institutional aid to be effectively implemented in the country, an effective accountability mechanism must be established in coordination with the government, civil society, and people's representatives so that this aid can be effectively implemented and Afghanistan can potentially achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n",

It's very difficult to provide an example of corruption! You might think that if there was so much widespread corruption, why would it be difficult to find such an example? The answer is that in all government projects, corruption was considered part of the job and was so institutionalized that no work could be considered exempt from corruption. Therefore, I mention the Ministry of Public Health's health project as an example. In the implementation of this important project, corruption was rampant and multi-faceted, which both delayed the project's completion and led to the ineffective use of international community aid.|One of the fundamental problems in Afghanistan is the conflict between tradition and modernity. This conflict manifests itself in various forms, sometimes as the government versus traditional society, and at other times in other forms such as modern education and schools, and so on.

If you look at the annual budget codes, you'll notice that a large portion of the allocated budgets hasn't been used. When you investigate the reason, you'll find that the local people have prevented the project from being implemented, saying it doesn't align with our traditions and customs. Specifically, I can mention the non-implementation of school construction projects in Khost and Logar provinces.|The Geneva meetings and the setting of 21 indicators by donors directly subordinated Afghanistan's policymaking and budget to foreign priorities.

However, this institution was unable or unwilling to solve the people's problems at their root, and now, with nearly a thousand homes built, they still lack municipal deeds and maps, and the government considers this land its own.

For example, it wants to provide low-interest loans to individuals in the agricultural sector or other businesses.

Conversely, the decisions of some politicians during the 2019-2020 elections, which were based on ethnic biases, led to unsuccessful outcomes. a) National interests take precedence over ethnic interests - positive example • Background: From 2011 to 2014, the security situation in Afghanistan was poor and the withdrawal of international forces had been announced. It was necessary for the army and national police to be able to defend the entire country. • Action: Hamid Karzai announced a program to expand the national army, under which young people from different ethnic groups were recruited jointly. The recruitment process was intentionally designed to represent all of Afghanistan instead of a specific ethnic group. • Result: A relative balance was created in the camp's structure, which strengthened the sense of national identity and increased its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. Although problems remained, this decision reflected a transnational vision. b) Decision based on ethnic preferences – a failed example • Background: In the 2019-2020 elections, there was intense competition among political groups. Some high-ranking officials were making decisions to appease their ethnic supporters. • Action: Some politicians, whose support was based on ethnicity, opposed the election results and declared a parallel government. Instead of supporting transparent trends and national unity, decisions became subject to ethnic preferences. • Result: A legitimacy crisis was created, public trust in the government decreased, and the ground was prepared for the Taliban to regroup. This is a clear example of the negative consequences of a lack of national vision.|The Kabul Bank case – a clear example of corruption • Background: Kabul Bank was the largest private bank in Afghanistan and was used to pay salaries and finance development projects. International aid and government financial programs were primarily channeled thru this bank. • Action: Between 2010 and 2013, senior bank officials and individuals close to the government illegally withdrew approximately billion for personal gain. This corruption occurred thru fake loans, personal expenses, and funding political networks. • Result: Projects were halted: Educational and health projects whose salaries and budgets were paid thru Kabul Bank were delayed for several months. The quality of services decreased: Teachers and doctors were unable to continue working due to not receiving their salaries, and the quality of educational and health services declined. Cutting off foreign aid: International partners, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF), suspended aid programs to Afghanistan until the government takes serious action against corruption. By October 2012, only a small portion of the stolen money had been recovered, severely damaging global trust. Consonance obstacle (harmony) • This case showed that corruption is not just a domestic problem, but also erodes the trust of international partners. • The cessation and cutting of aid destroyed the atmosphere of cooperation between the government and the world and became a major obstacle to development projects. Result: The Kabul Bank scandal is a clear answer to this question: corruption causes project delays, reduces service quality, and cuts off foreign aid. This experience proves that the lack of transparency and accountability is the biggest obstacle to coordinating development programs.|The gap between formal and traditional institutions • Province: Helmand • Problem: Conflict over water resources (Helmand River water division) Explanation :In Helmand province, the water distribution problem worsened due to poor cooperation between government agencies and traditional local councils. • Background: The Helmand River's seawater is of vital importance for agriculture. There was no coordination between the government's official programs and the traditional decisions of the local elders. • Result: Water disputes increased, some areas faced water scarcity, and agricultural production decreased. The lack of joint decision-making between formal and traditional institutions hindered problem-solving. Positive control sample • Province: Nangarhar • Problem: Property dispute • Result: Due to effective cooperation between the state court and the local jirga, the land dispute was resolved jointly and both parties accepted the decision. Result: These examples show that when there is no cooperation (like in Helmand), conflicts are prolonged. But when cooperation is effective (like in Nangarhar), the problem is solved relatively successfully.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic autonomy . Example: The 2013-2015 security strategy, which was based on US and NATO assistance. Background • Due to the withdrawal of international forces (2014), the Afghan government was forced to design a large part of its security strategy and budget based on US and NATO aid. • The priority of global war contributors with the Taliban was to help and maintain major cities, not to create widespread local stability. Action • The focus of the national security strategy was placed on cities and highways, as requested by global partners. • Security funding was reduced for remote areas because donors controlled resource allocation according to their own priorities. Negative consequences • Contrary to national interests: The government's need was to secure the villages, but due to external pressure, security was only concentrated in the cities. • Result: The Taliban's influence in remote areas increased. The government's legitimacy decreased. Instead of long-term stability, a short-term defensive strategy was formed that was at odds with national interests. Result: This example shows that when national policy is subject to the priorities of foreign donors, the government's strategic independence is weakened, and the outcome is detrimental to national interests.|Practical advice for the future. Recommendation: Aid should be spent thru the \"national single budget,\" but under the transparent oversight of local people and with independent accountability mechanisms. How to make it practical • 1. National Unified Budget Framework: All global aid must be spent thru the official government budget, not thru separate donor projects. This prevents the creation of parallel offices and ensures coordination with national programs. • 2. Local Monitoring: At the provincial and district levels, people's councils or civil society organizations should monitor the implementation of projects. This reduces corruption and increases public trust. • 3. Independent Accounting: A common accounting system should be established for the use of aid, involving the government, global donors, and civil society. Reasons based on failures • During the reconstruction of Afghanistan, much of the aid was spent outside the government budget, resulting in: or creating parallel offices, or weakening the government's legitimacy, the increase in corruption, and the loss of public trust. Reasons based on successes • Projects implemented thru national budgets and under public supervision (such as some rural development projects) were relatively successful because people considered them \"their own projects.\" Result: To succeed in war-torn countries, aid must be channeled solely thru the national budget and be spent under public oversight and an independent accounting system. This framework prevents corruption, strengthens government legitimacy, and increases public trust.\n",
    "ID_S2_021|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|In the previous government, for example, we had leaders who acted beyond ethnic and linguistic issues and beyond political affiliations, and they achieved positive results from their work. In the example in the \"Integrity\" section, we can cite the Minister of Public Health, Ferozuddin Feroz. Dr. Ferozuddin Feroz acted transnationally, transethnically, and transsectorally in the field of public health, achieving very positive results in the Ministry of Public Health and the health sector. These positive actions led to him being recognized as the best Minister of Public Health in the world.|In the widespread corruption that was known as one of the factors in the previous government, we can give a specific example: the discussion about one of the development projects in Charikar city, Parwan province. Widespread corruption among parliamentary lawyers and local strongmen caused the project to be halted. The concrete and asphalt paving project was for the Charikar city intersection, which is known as the same intersection of resistance. Here, the local strongmen pressured the international body or institution that was the donor for this project, demanding that our share be paid. The same company and the same institution that was the project implementer stopped the project, and it finally reached the point where, after 2021, during the Taliban's rule, the project was completed.|Foreign aid weakens the strategic decisions of the government and the nation because relying on foreign aid stifles initiative and makes us solely dependent on international and foreign assistance and cooperation. That's why we can't choose our own initiative and a correct perspective. For example, US aid and equipment for the training and education of the national army, which was entirely dependent on them, did not benefit the people much, and ultimately, the forces they deployed, Units 01 and 02, were deployed by them based on strategic decisions and plans that the government had not prepared or trained for, and ultimately, the US government took them with them. He took them with him, calling them his created and trained forces, not because they were being used effectively in Afghanistan's security affairs.|Afghanistan should have a thorough situation analysis based on impartial monitoring and surveys. Based on the analysis results and the situation, aid should be pledged to Afghanistan and transferred to Afghanistan thru Afghanistan's own national budget, and the use of this budget in Afghanistan should be monitored to prevent corruption in its expenditure. In other words, the institution or donor that is cooperating, or the international community itself, should closely monitor how its cooperation is being used. This is how monetary and financial corruption is prevented and a positive change is brought about in the work process.|\n",
    "ID_S2_022|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|A clear example of both states can be found during the Republic era (2011-2021). For example, we can recall Ashraf Ghani's decision to sign a security agreement with the United States, which he stated aimed to prioritize national interests over ethnic interests. Karzai refused to sign the treaty, but Hanif Atmar, the then foreign minister, signed the treaty on behalf of Ashraf Ghani in 2014. After the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the debate over signing a \"Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA)\" with the United States was heated. Hamid Karzai refused to sign it, considering it contrary to national independence. However, at the beginning of the National Unity Government, despite political pressure from various ethnic factions, Ashraf Ghani decided to sign it. Ashraf Ghani stated that the purpose of this action was to ensure the survival of the government structure and security forces, maintain financial aid, and prevent a security vacuum. Many Pashtun-centric figures within the government and Karzai's circle opposed it by signing, but Ghani called it a \"national necessity.\" After signing this agreement, Western financial and military support for the Afghan government continued until 2021, and the Nano mission to assist and equip the national army continued. The signing of this treaty strengthened the international legitimacy of the Afghan government. Although this decision sparked criticism, it was a rare example of prioritizing national interests (in line with the survival of the republican system and the country's security) despite ethnic and political pressures, and it had positive short-term results. It is worth mentioning that Rahmatullah Nabil (former head of national security) also opposed political and ethnic pressures multiple times during his tenure as head of national security (2014-2016) and emphasized strengthening national and non-ethnic structures within the intelligence services. His opposition to the release of some Taliban figures, particularly due to political and ethnic pressures, was a sign of prioritizing national interests over ethnic interests. Nabil's resignation in protest against Ashraf Ghani's personal and discriminatory policies (during his visit to Pakistan) was a sign of his nationalist stance. b) Ethnically biased and exclusionary decisions (2017-2020). During Ashraf Ghani's second term as president, appointments in security institutions – particularly the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the National Directorate of Security – took on a distinctly ethnic flavor. Many commanders and governors were appointed based on the criterion of \"ethnic loyalty,\" regardless of their professional and technical competence. for example, in 2018, Ashraf Ghani appointed General Tariq Shah Bahrami (affiliated with a specific ethnic circle) as Minister of Defense instead of Abdullah Habibi. These changes, along with the gradual removal of Tajik and Uzbek commanders from security structures, sparked strong political reactions in the north of the country. This displacement weakened cohesion within the security forces and widened the gap between the northern forces and the central government. These decisions also undermined trust within the resistance fronts against the Taliban, ultimately leading to the rapid fall of provinces in 2021 as a result of the collapse of the chain of command and lack of coordination among the forces. This type of ethnocentric decision-making was an example of ethnic interests overriding national interests, which led to the weakening of the security structure and the collapse of the republican system. At the end of his second term, instead of strengthening national institutions, Hamid Karzai (President until 2014) strengthened a network of ethnic and local commanders to maintain his ethnic influence in the south of the country. In appointing governors and security officials, he prioritized ethnic balance over merit, and instead of strengthening \"nation-building,\" he pursued a policy of \"ethnic appeasement\" to ensure his political survival. These decisions of his had bad consequences and It rooted the culture of ethnic dealing in the government structure and passed it on to the next government. It then became clear that these Karzai programs were steps toward paving the way for the Taliban, until Ghani completed Karzai's unfinished mission by handing over the Arg to the Taliban. Amrullah Saleh (Ashraf Ghani's first deputy and former national security chief), despite his anti-terrorism and nationalist record, spoke from an ethnic perspective in the final years of his cooperation with Ghani, contributing to the polarization of the political atmosphere. Also, some of his statements and positions on social media, instead of emphasizing \"national convergence,\" sometimes took on an ethnic and linguistic tone. Such positions reduced the capacity for national unity within the anti-Taliban resistance front in the final days of the Republic.|No response|A clear example of this type of project can be explained in Nangarhar province, where the dispute was over water distribution in the Serekan (Spin Ghar) district. Between 2016 and 2019, the dispute between the farmers of two villages over the distribution of water from the \"Kameh\" irrigation canal intensified due to a lack of coordination between the Nangarhar Water Basin Department and local councils. Because the government had changed the canal route without consulting local influentials, local conflicts erupted and agricultural lands remained dry for several months. In contrast, a project in Bamyan province can be mentioned where the dispute over the boundary of agricultural lands in the village of \"Shiber\" (2018-2019) was resolved thru dialog. In this case, close cooperation between the Bamyan Department of Agriculture and local elders led to the establishment of a mediation committee, resolving the dispute peacefully thru dialog.|A specific example of this project was the decision-making process regarding the implementation of the \"TAPI\" project (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline) around the years 2015-2021, with the Asian Development Bank and the government of Turkmenistan as donors. Explanation: The Afghan government, under pressure and encouragement from foreign donors, especially the Asian Development Bank, prioritized the advancement of the TAPI project to be recognized as a regionally supported energy transit route. However, in practice, insecurity along the project route and the lack of guarantyd real benefits for the people of Afghanistan led to national investment in domestic energy infrastructure (such as electricity generation from northern gas or domestic dams) being overlooked. The failure of this project to materialize had negative consequences. This project never materialized, diverting government attention from more urgent domestic projects, increasing Afghanistan's political dependence on regional countries; as a result, Afghanistan's national interests were sacrificed to the geopolitical priorities of the donors.|Aid should be 100% channeled thru the government's national budget and monitored by the local people, not thru separate donor projects. Practical advice: In any post-war reconstruction program, before allocating funds and starting projects, a \"tripartite partnership structure\" must be established between the central government, local institutions, and civil society to ensure joint decision-making on priorities and monitoring of implementation. One successful example of this project was the Citizen Covenant program. In the \"Citizenship Covenant\" program (2016-2020), when village development councils participated in decision-making about small projects (such as roads or schools), the projects were implemented on time and with quality. However, in projects that were planned solely by ministries or foreign donors (such as some World Bank projects in the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development), work either stopped or the quality decreased due to local distrust and administrative corruption. This poor quality of projects will be resolved when they have genuine participation. This showed that without the genuine participation of the people and local leaders in design and monitoring, no foreign aid, even if it amounts to billions of dollars, will be sustainable or used effectively.\n",
    "ID_S2_023|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|Multinational countries and diverse societies need leaders who have a national and transnational vision to facilitate peaceful coexistence among all ethnic groups and various socio-political groups in light of the country/society's prevailing laws. My visit, along with that of former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, with the perspective of prioritizing ethnic interests, paved the way in 2021 for the downfall of a legitimate, inclusive government in favor of a specific ethnic group (the Taliban), both of whom are from the same ethnic background (Pashtun). He removed experienced and influential individuals from the ranks of the security forces and civil positions, gradually handed over districts to the Taliban one after another, and finally brought an end to the 20-year Republic with his own escape.|Many international partners were involved in the corruption of high-ranking Afghan officials, and in many cases, they prevented their prosecution by judicial and legal institutions. In my opinion, the hypothesis that widespread corruption was the main obstacle to cooperation between the government and international partners is incorrect. On the contrary, high-ranking government officials and most of their international partners were complicit in widespread corruption, including the law, police, judiciary, prosecution, parliament, and the military. Everything was under the control of this corrupt gang; there was no second authority to hold them accountable, and everyone was in cahoots. I have personally seen dozens of infrastructure projects that, despite consuming huge sums of money, have not lasted due to poor quality and are currently unusable.|One of the main reasons for the lack of institutionalization of laws in Afghanistan's various systems has been these traditional tribal structures, and in many cases, despite the clarity of the law, disputes were resolved by local elders, which often resulted in injustice in the decisions of local councils and tribal elders' assemblies. Traditional and tribal structures have never been supportive of the rule of law in the country; on the contrary, these structures have weakened the law.|Exactly, governments dependent on foreign aid are not independent in their decision-making. For example: The extraction of the Aynak copper mine in Logar province was awarded by the then government to a Chinese company, but due to the disagreements and conflicts between China and Western countries, led by the United States, and because the Chinese company was also the financial backer of the then government, the extraction of this national project was not allowed to be realized, and the government was obliged to follow the policies and guidelines of the United States.|Not all countries are in the same state after a war; some may need to rebuild buildings, roads, bridges, and highways. However, some of these countries may have a serious need and priority for education, promoting the rule of law, strengthening national unity, raising citizens' knowledge levels, avoiding violence, and so on. Okay. In any case, international aid should be distributed and used thru the government institutions of the war-torn country with international supervision.\n",

The Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Directorate, without consulting the village council and local elders, decided to change the water distribution route in the secondary canal to help the new irrigation project. Local leaders and the local council considered this decision unilateral and contrary to the previous agreement, and prevented its implementation. The government was also unable to implement the decision without local support. Result : The channel remained closed for about two months. Agricultural lands in both villages were dry and damaged. Physical and armed clashes occurred between young people from two villages, and several people were injured. The issue was only temporarily resolved after a joint council was formed between the government and local elders.|It is clear that non-discretionary budgets (foreign aid) have a negative impact on the independent decision-making of government institutions. A specific answer will be provided below. Decision Topic: Increasing the size of security forces beyond the country's financial capacity Time: 2011-2014. Effective Donor: United States and NATO. Area: Security Policy and National Budget. Following the Chicago and Tokyo conferences, international donors, particularly the United States, emphasized the rapid increase in the number of Afghan security forces (army and police) to approximately 352,000 personnel. This decision was based more on NATO's military objectives than on an assessment of Afghanistan's economic and administrative capacity. Why was it against national interests? The Afghan government had warned that the national budget could not afford to pay the salaries, logistics, and maintenance of this number of troops, but accepted the proposal due to its dependence on foreign aid. Negative consequences: Creating strong financial dependence; over 90% of security expenditures were paid for by foreign aid. After aid was reduced in the years 1398-1400, livelihoods and equipping units faced difficulties. Inability to maintain expensive equipment and aircraft that could only be operated by foreign specialists. Decreased morale and the collapse of the command structure in the final months of the regime.|The intervention of the international community should be contingent on non-interference in political and economic decision-making.

    "ID_S2_025|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|: A) In short and concise terms, a decision by a senior Afghan government official that prioritized national interests over ethnic interests, and which had positive results, led the government to decide in the years 2011-2021 to implement the important infrastructure project of constructing a major highway that begins at the Kabul axis and ends in Bamyan and Daikundi, as well as along the Baghlan route, which connects the aforementioned provinces to the center of Kabul, based on national priorities. Despite political and ethnic pressures to divert funds to specific routes and regions, the project was implemented in accordance with public needs and national interests. The importance of this project was that it connected several central and northern provinces of Afghanistan with each other and with the capital. Result: - Transportation routes and the movement of merchants' goods between the aforementioned provinces were facilitated, and costs were reduced. - Public satisfaction increased, and people's trust in the government and the ruling system grew. - This project was one of the national projects in the decade (2010-2020) that was implemented regardless of ethnic affiliation. - The connection of the Herat, Badghis, Faryab, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Ghazni routes, where people from the mentioned regions live with different ethnicities and languages, has connected their network, which demonstrates effective leadership free from ethnic interests. - Result: Positive, and its consequences: - Connecting important central, northern, and western provinces, reducing travel costs and facilitating travel for passengers, transporting goods, and increasing trade between provinces. - Widespread public satisfaction and increased trust between the people of the provinces and the center emerged. -Note: If you wish, you can also consider the road network and the connection of the Bamyan, Yakawlang-Kotel-e Qonaq-Nili (the center of Daikundi) and Jaghori routes as part of this large national network. B) Making a decision that was influenced by ethnic bias and had an unsuccessful and ineffective outcome: During the period 2011-2021, actions and measures were taken in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health based on ethnic tendencies, network affiliation, and group affiliation, which: - In the Ministry of Education and Health, appointments and placements of individuals in key positions were made based on ethnic and group affiliation, while specialized and experienced staff were sidelined and individuals lacking experience and expertise were appointed to important and key positions. - In the years 2016-2018, official reports from Faryab, Paktia, Logar, and Takhar provinces showed that: - School construction and textbook printing projects were delayed due to poor management and corruption. - The books were not distributed on time. - Corruption in contracts increased. - Some donor-funded projects were canceled. - This is a clear example of decision-making failure influenced by bias.|Widespread corruption clearly had negative effects on international projects. There are specific examples of projects being delayed due to corruption. The National Rural Water Supply Program project in Uruzgan and Helmand provinces from 2014-2016, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in collaboration with the World Bank, carried out rural water supply projects. According to information (reports) from Uruzgan and Helmand: - Local contractors embezzled part of the budget. - The drilling quality was unsatisfactory, and the water tank preparation was of poor quality. - The financial documents lacked transparency. Result: The World Bank halted the project for several months, and thousands of families were left without access to clean water. Reduced service quality: Health programs in the Ministry of Public Health, in 2017, in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, and Farah, reported that health implementing companies had illegally withdrawn a portion of the budget, which resulted in: - Clinics were left without medicine or medical supplies. - Employe salaries haven't been paid for months. - Maternal and child mortality increased, and the quality of health service delivery severely declined and even collapsed. - Cutting off foreign aid due to corruption: The printing and publication of textbooks in the Ministry of Education in 1397 (solar year) was supported by international donors, especially the European Union. After the exposure of corruption in the printing and publication contracts for hundreds of thousands of textbooks for education students, the following decisions were made: - They completely cut off the budget that had been allocated. - The project's execution was halted pending complete reviews. - Millions of students were unable to receive books in the next academic year. - The Ministry of Education's credibility was questioned and the level of trust in it decreased significantly.|The effects of the gap between formal and traditional institutions. There are clear examples where projects have faced difficulties in implementation due to poor cooperation between formal and traditional institutions. In Baghlan Province - Burka District: Problems and conflicts over the distribution of irrigation canal water in 2015. Without coordinating or consulting with local elders, the government implemented a new water distribution plan. This action resulted in: - Two villages entered into conflict and dispute. - Several acres of land were destroyed. - The canal improvement project was halted for several months. Matters that have been resolved correctly and effectively due to effective cooperation between formal and traditional institutions: In Herat Province, Injil District: Problems and disputes arose between the two families (tribes) regarding irrigated lands. To resolve this issue, the government, in collaboration with the local council, the tribal jirga, the land authorities, held joint meetings and sessions, which resulted in: - The conflict was resolved non-violently. - The land was officially registered by the government. - The irrigation project that was beyond was implemented without any problems.|How foreign aid affects the government's independent decision-making. A) Supportive effects on government decision-making: In the years 2011-2016, the United States and NATO insisted and emphasized the implementation of development budgets in the security sector. Donors insisted that more budget be spent on creating security forces, building bases, and equipping the police. The government was forced to: - Transfer a large portion of development budget from economic and infrastructure projects to security-focused (security) projects. B) Negative consequences and repercussions (contrary to national interests) that resulted in the following: - Economic projects (road construction, energy, agriculture) were underfunded and poorly developed. - The level of economic growth decreased and slowed down. - The country's dependence on foreign aid increased. - It created public dissatisfaction with the lack of development services.|Practical recommendations for the future (Framework for assistance) Based on the lessons learned over the years and real-world experience in Afghan society, how should it be and what should be done? Based on past experiences, it is suggested that international aid to Afghanistan (a post-conflict country) be implemented in a hybrid model. How? - 50% of the aid will be implemented and operationalized thru the national government budget, under the supervision of an independent body, civil society councils, and the media. - 50% of the aid will be implemented thru independent donor projects to reduce the risks of politicization and corruption. Perhaps we can find an example of this model in the Citizen Contract Program (CCNPP), where local community monitoring led to greater transparency and trust. It is also worth noting that at the same time and during that era, the helpers maintained their technical roles, which had a positive outcome.\"\"\"\n",

    "ID_S1_004|10/25/2025 4:19:02|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|2016–2021|After 2001, it was essential for any Afghan leader to enjoy comprehensive rule and strategic legitimacy. First, comprehensive rule was necessary to pursue the unification of Afghanistan's religions, ethnicities, and tribes into a single state and national identity. Years of violent conflict had torn apart the fabric of Afghan society, and almost everywhere in Afghanistan, the risk of destruction from political unrest was higher than usual. Only through leadership that embraces power sharing and representation can Afghanistan hope to achieve a certain level of political stability and social cohesion. Second, as much as reestablishing state authority will be part of the maturation of the Afghan state, strategic legitimacy locally, regionally, and globally will be fundamental to this transformation. Domestic legitimacy has been based on two main objectives: responding to citizens' needs and providing a minimum level of services, and respecting Islamic and traditional values, which are also important elements of domestic legitimacy. Restoring international legitimacy and gaining a certain level of diplomatic credibility requires some ability to counter foreign influence and address negative perceptions of living under the tutelage of external actors and their sovereign powers. Without a legitimate foundation, any government risks being seen as an external power transfer, and the absence of legitimacy undermines any progress toward long-term stability.|Afghan leaders have made progress, but they also have to deal with ongoing challenges in bringing together formal government institutions and traditional institutions like the Loya Jirga and local councils. Programs such as the Loya Jirga and the National Solidarity Program have involved local leaders in some decision-making and development initiatives, although they have not always been effective. In many locations, local loyalties, instability, and lack of government capacity have made it difficult to fully integrate these systems.|Heavy reliance on foreign funding and technical assistance hampered the development of self-reliant and accountable strategic thinking among Afghan leaders, as donors predetermined or influenced a large portion of the budget and major projects. As a result, leaders generally felt compelled to prioritize donor commitments over national priorities. This, in turn, fostered a dependency mindset that stifled initiative and weakened local accountability, as success came to be defined more by satisfying foreign partners than by addressing the realities faced by Afghan citizens.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Neutral|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Neutral|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|Aside from the financial situation, the significant weakness affecting service delivery and policy implementation was the limited capability and expertise in government institutions. Many ministries and local offices did not have qualified staff, systems, or coordination, which ultimately created significant obstacles to mobilize plans into action. This affected timeliness, productivity, and public frustrations across all sectors, including health, education, and infrastructure. |Inability to provide security|An example is Afghanistan's National Solidarity Program (NSP), which empowered people at the community level through Community Development Councils. By engaging with local elders and taking into account customary decision-making processes, the program was culturally appropriate and unearthed community priorities delivering educational, transportation, and water infrastructure. Conversely, programs that did not respect cultural contexts were likely to be rejected by communities, underscoring the critical importance of cultural appropriateness in programming.|The key takeaway from 2001-2021 is that effective and acceptable governance is not created just from external funding or external institutions; it has to be central to local political reality and social trust. In Afghanistan, efforts were primarily centered on creating a formal structure and the institution needed to satisfy donor expectations, yet when institutions lacked legitimacy to traditional leadership, customary practices, and citizen need, they were often presented an illusion of legitimacy. Sustainable governance requires a balance between contemporary state institutions and local authority, security, the provision of basic services, and accountability grounded in the people themselves.|Not provided\n",

Designed to promote transparency and reduce land disputes, the program failed to deliver positive results in many areas due to poor coordination with social structures and local values, such as the role of jirga councils and people's trust in local mediation. People continued to view local solutions as more credible and fair than resorting to official channels.|The most important lesson of this course is that effective and legitimate governance is sustainable when its political and social ownership arises from within the society, not imposed from without. In a country like Afghanistan, legitimacy does not come from the ballot box or international support alone; it requires internal consensus, coherence with the cultural and social context, transparency, and genuine participation of the people in decision-making. Governance is strengthened when formal state structures, local community values, and traditional institutions are connected; stability and legitimacy are undermined when this connection is ignored.|Yes! An important point that has been less addressed is the importance of institutional continuity in the process of state-building in Afghanistan. Experience has shown that extensive, accelerated, and person-centered changes in leadership, diplomacy, and government structures have caused no policy or program to survive. In the absence of continuity, capacities were not accumulated, historical memory was not formed, and each government effectively started from scratch. In my opinion, if policies and institutions had structural stability, a culture of accountability, and a program-centered approach, many domestic and international efforts in the path of state-building in Afghanistan would have had more lasting and effective results.\n",

    "ID_S1_012|10/26/2025 17:36:30|Former Afghan Government Official|2011–2015, 2016–2021|In my opinion, given Afghanistan's unique characteristics, not only over the past 20 years but also in the future, an effective leader can only be effective if, as a first step, they have a cross-ethnic vision for the country and consider Afghanistan to be connected to and dependent on all of its ethnic groups. Second, they must be specialized. To overcome and properly manage the crisis, they must assemble a team of experts to organize matters with complete competence, experience, and understanding. In short, a cross-ethnic vision and a specialized, experience-centered vision are essential characteristics of an effective leader in Afghanistan.|Afghan leaders managed to build relationships between official institutions and traditional structures to some extent, but this balance was unstable. For example, during the reigns of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, the Loya Jirga councils were used for national decision-making, but no sustainable coordination with government institutions was established.|Unfortunately, Afghanistan was completely dependent on aid from the international community, and this total dependence meant that, in times of crisis and decision-making, the country's leaders were unable to make independent decisions based on the national interests of the country. As a result, the outcome and repercussions of this situation were exactly what the United States wanted.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Widespread corruption|I disagree with the lack of financial resources.

It is a very detailed story that cannot be described here.|I think the biggest lesson that can be learned is that if a country like Afghanistan wants to emerge from the crisis, they must be careful in choosing and appointing their leaders, they must vote for people who will work for Afghanistan, and in the second step, the priority of the leaders and all the people should be the collective interests of the country. We voted based on ethnic affiliations, the leaders decided based on their ethnic affiliations, and the result was that the country became more critical. The big lesson is to appoint people based on their competence, honesty, and expertise, not ethnic affiliations, language, etc. In short, post-conflict countries need competent and honest people who prioritize the interests of the country above everything else.|While recalling the issues mentioned above, the most important issue that is vital for Afghanistan is governance away from emotions; over the past few decades, we have tried to turn the country into a battlefield and a conflict between neighbors with emotional policies. Afghanistan will not develop unless a neighbor called Pakistan feels at ease with us. Strategic wisdom dictates that we observe moderation in our relations between India and Pakistan to protect ourselves from possible harm from Pakistan, which we have unfortunately not done so far.\n",
    "ID_S1_013|10/26/2025 17:42:03|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|2011–2015|In my opinion, the two most important qualities for an effective Afghan leader after 2001 were: 1. The ability to build national unity: After years of war and ethnic conflict, an effective leader must be able to build trust and solidarity among different groups, ethnicities, and religions in order to lay the foundations for a sustainable nation-state. 2. Commitment to transparency and fighting corruption: During the reconstruction period in Afghanistan, rampant corruption was one of the main challenges. A leader who emphasizes transparency, accountability, and justice is able to maintain the trust of the people and the international community and make the development process sustainable.|Unfortunately, customs and traditions still prevail in many parts of the country, and tribal values are paramount. On the other hand, during the 20-year republic, some outsiders did not believe in these customs and traditions, and some even showed an excessive desire to use them to polish their image in front of the public by respecting customs and traditions. In my opinion, the result of these trends was a more critical situation in the country. We have multifaceted crises and problems in the country that must be solved with modern science, a specialized perspective, and effective diplomacy, or at least a reasonable solution must be found for them. However, not only did we lack a logical and specialized perspective in this area, but we also wanted to solve the country's most sensitive problems through the Loya Jirga, a council whose members are mostly illiterate or have limited education. In fact, the country's constitution stipulates that the constitution can be amended through the Loya Jirga, although it has its own procedures. In my opinion, after 2001, Afghan leaders were only able to build effective bridges between official state institutions and traditional structures, such as local councils and jirgas, to a limited extent. On the one hand, attempts were made to use traditional structures in decision-making. For example, the 2003 Constitutional Loya Jirga, the Consultative Peace Jirga, and the Jirga for the Release of Taliban Prisoners in subsequent years were examples of using local traditions to legitimize national decisions. These councils helped people feel that they had a stake in the political process. On the other hand, in many cases, a gap remained between the central government and local structures. The government failed to integrate these traditional institutions into the formal system in a sustainable manner. As a result, government decisions were sometimes met with opposition or mistrust at the local level. In short, attempts were made to build links, but these links were not sustainable or institutionalized, and one of the main weaknesses in the Afghan state-building process remained.|Overreliance on international financial and technical assistance has had profound effects on the development of independent strategic thinking among Afghan leaders. On the one hand, this reliance has led to the country's overall planning and decision-making being influenced by the priorities, policies, and interests of donor countries, rather than the real needs of Afghan society. As a result, many leaders focused on attracting foreign support to seize power and manage aid resources, rather than on developing sustainable national strategies. On the other hand, this situation has weakened the culture of domestic accountability; when budgets and resources are mainly provided from abroad, leaders feel less pressure to be accountable to the people. In other words, they derived their legitimacy more from international support than from public satisfaction. As a result, excessive reliance on foreign aid has hindered the growth of intellectual independence, institutional self-sufficiency, and political accountability among the Afghan leadership.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not very effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, rampant corruption, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|In addition to a lack of financial resources, one of the most notable internal weaknesses of Afghan state institutions was their lack of effective administrative and organizational capacities, coupled with rampant corruption.

Be serious about implementing and enforcing the rule of law.|Informal institutions in Afghanistan have historically been important for resolving issues. Leaders and government officials have attempted to use this method to make decisions that address the country's best interests. However, in modern governance, non-traditional institutions that are not formed on the basis of a social contract do not have sufficient authority and credibility to make major decisions at the national level. Leaders or political elites in Afghanistan, who were in fact the traditional leaders of society, believed in this method as a solution to major national problems. Before the Taliban came to power, Afghan governments often turned to consultative jirga councils to resolve national issues and even make decisions affecting their foreign policy. One of the clearest examples of this issue is the release of 400 Taliban prisoners from the prisons of the legitimate Afghan government in 2020 through the \"Peace Council or Consultative Meeting.\"|Over-reliance on international resources has prevented political leaders from paying attention to and thinking about local resources. At the same time, the misuse of these resources has led to the emergence of polluted economic islands, where leaders no longer see themselves as indebted to national resources and interests.

Second, he must be honest and accountable to his people—a leader who stands with his people, leads them through their pain, grief, and hopes, and leads them with honesty.|He believes that Afghan leaders have many ways to build an effective relationship between formal government institutions and traditional communities and structures. Most of the time, both systems were in a state of distrust. The executive branch of the high command spent a lot of time on energy, which was important to him. On the other hand, traditional and tribal councils are crowded with government officials, have elders who do not trust them, and are rife with political corruption. In addition, traditional and local councils are more isolated from the armed forces and the opposition. Some political leaders have tried, but unfortunately, their symbolic efforts have been short-lived. In the case of the Loya Jirga, a local jirga was formed, the debate was managed, and everything was symbolic of his policies. Overall, this relationship remained incomplete—neither traditional structures, nor formal government institutions, nor the trust of the people were strengthened.|I believe that the country has relied too heavily on foreign political leaders and financial and technical assistance, which has weakened Afghan leaders' sense of national responsibility and independent strategic thinking. When equipment is the last important part of the organization, we can clearly see how weak mid-level government managers are, as well as their independence, strategic thinking, and responsibility. The sense of ownership of the country and the government has been seriously damaged, and the country has become heavily dependent on foreigners and their financial and technical assistance. After 2016, many leaders tried to reduce dependence on the homeland and restore responsibility. Remember some examples. For example, in 2016, Americans seriously discussed strengthening the country's air force. Similarly, we have only 157 Black Hawk helicopters. The air force has received dozens of transport and large military equipment, giant fighter jets, fighter jets, and bombers. Every six months, dozens of young people in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Europe, and the United States receive training in the Air Force. For example, when the former president seriously discussed the Case Management System (CMS), he took the matter to the US Supreme Court. In front of millions of American citizens, biometric data and its transfer were discussed, the nationality of topographic information was discussed, security responsibilities were transferred, and he also had a lot of work under his control, but he did his best, did not feel ownership, relied on foreign countries, and ultimately paved the way for the fall.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|I believe that the most serious impact is weak internal institutions, corruption, political interference, and weak capacity (capacity gap).

The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) launched the Afghan National Integration Program around 2003 with the help of the World Bank. This program aims to empower villagers to make decisions and develop and implement projects. De Biera's factors: 1. Social values of harmony: The Afghan Rural Council Program, the Jirga Council, and the Partnership should be established. The villagers chose the Shura Council (Village Development Council) and decided to implement the project (road, water, school, bridge, electricity, etc.). 2. Trust and sense of ownership among the people: When the people participated in decision-making, they felt that they were managing the project themselves, not the government or foreigners. Corruption became more difficult. 3. Gradual participation of women: In areas where traditional restrictions exist, the structure of women's councils should be introduced gradually and cautiously. Da Franji prevented conflict and paved the way for Kibledo. The result: more than 35,000 projects benefited from the National Solidarity Program, and thousands of small development projects improved people's lives. The Community Development Program of the World Bank and other institutions is a successful example.

This leader must have strategic leadership and the ability to make decisive decisions in order to pursue a clear strategy for the country's stability, security, and long-term economic growth. A close relationship with the people and a deep understanding of the nation's needs and values are also essential for a leader, as the trust of the people is the foundation of any legitimate system. In addition, the leader of international relations must have the ability to manage effectively, so that the national interests of Afghanistan and its international partners are protected in a balanced manner.|After 2001, the Afghan government leadership faced political and administrative complexities in achieving an effective balance between formal institutions and traditional community structures, namely jirgas and local councils. The political and social reality in Afghanistan shows that traditional structures of legitimacy, arbitration, and social order are based on historical provisions, while formal government institutions represent modern governance, accountability, and the rule of law. Although some leaders have attempted to integrate the two by establishing consultative councils, these efforts have often failed to achieve effective coordination and long-term action. For example, the adoption of the Loya Jirga constitution and the participation of the people is a symbolic example, and the decision itself has not been fully implemented at the political or administrative level of the Loya government. Overall, the efforts of Afghan leaders and formal and informal institutions to build an effective bridge have been limited because they do not appreciate traditions and structures. This should be recognized as an authentic form, not only in modern state-building, but also in line with the principles of a sustainable framework.|His analysis, leadership of Afghanistan, international financial and technical assistance, and heavy reliance on independent strategic thinking and responsiveness had a profound impact on the institution. This dependence has often forced leaders to follow the requirements and conditions of international donors, limiting their ability to make independent, long-term policy decisions. It will also weaken the culture of accountability, because decisions about responsibility and accountability will, in most cases, depend on foreign institutions and their expectations. In addition, reliance on foreign aid has also limited local innovation, capacity building, and national resources based on decision-making capacity, damaging the government's legitimacy and public confidence.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|In addition to limited financial resources, limited human and administrative capacity in Afghan government institutions is one of the biggest internal obstacles that has had a profound impact on service delivery and policy implementation. Many institutions lack sufficient professional staff, administrative skills, and technical skills, limiting their ability to effectively meet the needs of the people. In addition, deficiencies in internal organizational structures, centralized decision-making, high centralization, lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms, and weak inter-agency coordination have prevented the effective implementation of policies. Overall, this internal weakness has not only led to a decline in service quality, but has also created a series of challenges in promoting government legitimacy and public trust, requiring a comprehensive strategic plan for future policymaking and government reforms.|Inability to provide security and rampant corruption|Afghanistan's Women's Rights Development Program, which is an important effort in governance and social reforms after 2001, can be presented as an important example that people have experienced both success and failure with social and cultural values.

In addition, local leaders, communities, and cultural sensitivities take into account the lack of diplomatic efforts and international cooperation and influence.

At that time, Afghanistan was facing serious economic problems, such as energy shortages and restrictions on regional trade. Ashraf Ghani emphasized the priority of national interests and considered the overall interests of the country to be superior to ethnic or regional interests. He actively participated in international negotiations, signed relevant agreements, and approved the necessary internal measures for pipeline construction, such as land use and route selection. Although the project is not yet complete, Ghani's decision has paved the way for the expansion of regional economic cooperation and the creation of job opportunities for the people of Afghanistan, and has given the country international economic credibility. This is an example where national interests took precedence over ethnic interests and had positive outcomes.|Direct experience from a road construction project in Parwan province in 2017 showed how administrative and financial corruption hinders coordination. During the implementation of the contracts for this project, some contracting companies did not properly adhere to road construction standards, and in some sections, only a thin layer of sand was used. According to reports from local people and the press, the project delays and poor road quality were linked to corruption, as contracts were often awarded in the names of influential individuals. As a result, not only was the road quality poor, but coordination between government agencies and international partners was also slow, and service delivery to local people was affected. This example illustrates how corruption can have a serious negative impact on project implementation, service quality, and the coordination system.|A long-standing water distribution problem in Laghman province of Afghanistan has worsened due to poor cooperation between official institutions and local leaders. The provincial Department of Agriculture tried to start the construction project of a canal, but a place for consultation with the local jirgas and councils was not selected.

The government agencies relied solely on administrative orders, without providing opportunities for trust and participation to local leaders. The outcome was that the project was delayed, water distribution conflicts increased, and public dissatisfaction grew. This example illustrates that coordination between formal and traditional structures plays a vital role in resolving local conflicts.|The police building program in Afghanistan is an example where foreign aid had a negative impact against national interests. A lot of money was spent by international donors to fund and equip the police, but not enough attention was given to managing and building the capacity of the Afghan government's security sector. This process weakened the Afghan government's sovereignty and was driven solely by foreign priorities, not based on Afghanistan's long-term security needs. As a result, there was an increase in police corruption and a weakening of the government system, which had consequences against national interests.|A practical recommendation for Afghanistan's reconstruction is that the international community should implement each aid project thru Afghanistan's national budget and national institutions, rather than having different projects managed by separate donors. This not only prevents the waste of resources but also helps strengthen the country's governmental capacities. A joint fund should be established for aid, with financial oversight and management thru the Ministry of Finance, and project monitoring given to representatives of the community and government. Project implementation should be based on the consultation and participation of local people to ensure their needs are met correctly and to increase project effectiveness. To this end, the transparency of all projects and the monitoring of results should be done thru financial and non-financial audits.

    "ID_S2_009|International Diplomat/Representative of an International Organization|Regarding the transnational leader: In 2020, I was working at the Ministry of Water and Energy as the Director of Water Affairs Regulation for the General Directorate of the Kabul River Basin. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, initiated a move to divide the Ministry of Water and Energy into two agencies: the National Water Affairs Regulatory Authority and the National Energy Affairs Regulatory Authority. From an administrative perspective, this was a positive and national act because Afghanistan produces approximately 75 billion cubic meters of water annually but is unable to utilize 20% of this total due to mismanagement. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a single agency for comprehensive management of water resources to control Afghanistan's water resources thru a strategic plan spanning approximately 5 years and 10 years. Part A: This was a positive step toward economic growth for the country, improving agriculture from the water infrastructure. Part B: This action by the president failed because the president had ethnic and personal motives for two reasons. First, he turned the ministry into an administration because he wanted to be allowed by the constitution to appoint anyone to head an administration without needing a vote from parliament to elect them. Secondly, according to the agreements of the unity government, the Ministry of Water and Energy belonged to Dr. Abdullah. How could he have his close associates in this ministry when he had turned the ministry into a management?|Corruption as an obstacle to coordination, there were two reasons for the president to carry out widespread corruption. First, he appointed someone close to him to head the administration, and thru this, he was able to implement the infrastructure projects for the imaginary water facilities and add their cost to his capital, which he almost did. Or, he contracted and implemented the infrastructure projects for the water facilities with several companies that were from his own people, and he did. I witnessed several projects; a small example of this was the maintenance and care of the Darunta Dam, which cost approximately 53 million Afghanis. This project was contracted by a company from his own people, and it can be said that this project was contracted for 25 million. Secondly, according to the law, the head of the administration was appointed by the president, and this head of the administration was accountable and reported to no one other than the president. Even Parliament, the embodiment of the people's will, did not have the authority to remove or hold them accountable.|Regarding the gap between the formal and dominant institutions, I must say that since the ministries and departments were restructured, the president, according to the constitution, had the authority to choose the head of the department himself. Parliament, which represented the people, had no vote or authority in this process. For this reason, a person close to power or with political influence was usually appointed to head the departments, rather than technical and expert individuals. The person who was appointed only reported to the president and was not accountable to any other institution. For example, in the Surkh Rod district of Nangarhar province (the Sultanpur area), a project to build a protective wall was implemented. I don't remember the exact cost, but it was very high. This project was approved thru the Ministry of Energy and Water at the time. The wall was supposed to be two and a half meters high below ground, hidden from public view, but it was only built to a height of about one and a half meters; another meter remained incomplete, and unsuitable materials were used. When the flood came, the wall collapsed and caused extensive damage to people's land. People complained, but because the head of the department and his close associates were involved at the top of the project, no one dared to follow up. The implementing company was also owned by the head of the department himself and was mostly selected based on ethnic ties. At that time, such disputes were unsolvable because when the project is the government itself and the government's power is behind it, the people have no way to resist. As a result, the problem remained unresolved and no authority had the jurisdiction to investigate.|At the National Water Resources Management Authority where I worked, foreign aid played a very effective role. No independent decisions were made; most projects were funded thru the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and the implementation of the projects depended on these resources. When the Ministry of Energy and Water was transformed into the National Water Regulatory Authority, a new problem arose: the authority was no longer accountable to parliament because its head was appointed by the president and only reported to him. There was no regulatory authority (except for the president himself). For this reason, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank stopped their aid. They said, \"We will not give money to an office that is not accountable and cannot be questioned.\" While the minister was approved by parliament and accountable to the people when the ministry existed. However, the administration lacked such legitimacy, which is why many of the projects that were in the plan were not implemented and remained unfinished.|Based on my experience with the reconstruction situation in Afghanistan, if the international community wants to intervene in post-war countries, it should provide aid thru non-governmental and international organizations (NGOs), not directly thru the government. Because when aid is channeled thru the government, there is usually nepotism, ethnic discrimination, and widespread corruption. The minister gives orders to his close associates, they pass them on to their employes, and the result is that the budget doesn't reach the real people. But in the international model: • A donor entity provides the funds, and a specific institution implements the project. • The second body independently (directly or indirectly) monitors whether the aid has reached the intended recipients. • Separate oversight reduces corruption and increases transparency. For this reason, if aid is provided thru international organizations and strong monitoring teams are in place, no one can act against global standards and people will benefit more from the results.\n",

However, in Nangarhar province, administrative corruption at the level of the Public Health Directorate and local contractors led to contracts being awarded to affiliated companies and the work being carried out poorly. Many clinics remained unfinished, and the WHO temporarily suspended funding for the project. Administrative corruption hindered people's access to healthcare services and reduced the confidence of donors.|In 2018, the government initiated the Jaghori Dam project in Ghazni province without consulting the people of Andar district. People protested because they said the watercourse passed thru their land and their rights were being ignored. Because government officials did not cooperate with local elders and guilds, tensions escalated and the project was halted for several months. The lack of cooperation between the government and traditional structures caused delays in the project and led to public distrust.|From 2017 to 2020, several development projects in road construction and water supply were implemented in Daikundi province by USAID and UNOPS. Foreign donors themselves determined the routes, companies, and even the type of building materials, without sufficient coordination with the local administration or the people. Local officials suggested the road route pass thru more populated areas so more people could benefit, but because the final decision was made at the Kabul headquarters with the input of foreign consultants, the less beneficial route was chosen. The project was implemented at a high cost but with less benefit.|Afghanistan's experience shows that when decisions are made without consulting the people, transparency, and a national perspective, the outcome is usually failure; whether in ethnic decisions, government and administrative discussions, or projects implemented under foreign influence. Therefore, in any future international intervention, the aid framework should revolve around a few principles: first, national ownership – decisions should be made domestically, with the leadership of the government and local people, not in foreign offices, and not with the ethnic bias of past governments. Second, accountability and transparency – all projects must be implemented thru the national budget to enable monitoring and accountability. Third, public consultation – local councils and community elders should be involved in project design and monitoring from the outset to prevent ethnic and social conflicts. And in the financial resources section, there needs to be very close monitoring and auditing to prevent financial corruption.\n",
    "ID_S2_011|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|About transnational leadership during the National Unity Government or the Republic from 2014-2020 is that the appointment of governors and heads of departments in Ghor was often based on ethnic affiliation and political pressure, not on merit. In several cases, individuals close to specific ethnic factions were appointed to head local departments such as Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Education, and Health. The result was increased ethnic competition between Tajiks, Hazaras, and Pashtuns within the administration, reduced coordination between institutions, many development projects remained unfinished, people lost trust in the administration, and social divisions widened.|Corruption as an obstacle to the coordination of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development's development projects, especially water supply and road construction projects in the province's districts. Contract companies were selected thru the mediation of some local officials, and a large portion of the project budget was embezzled. Some projects were never completed at all, or their quality was very low. As a result, donors like USAID and UNDP halted a portion of the funding, and project implementation was delayed for several years. Local people lost trust in government institutions.|The gap between the formal and traditional institutions of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, which implemented an irrigation project without consulting local jirgas. Because the stream's path passed thru land belonging to another village and their consent had not been obtained, the conflict between the two villages escalated and the project was halted. Several months later, negotiations were resumed with the mediation of tribal elders, but government institutions had already lost their credibility.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic governance in adapting aid projects, particularly in the health and education sectors, which were funded by foreign entities such as USAID and the World Bank. Decision-making regarding priorities and budget was primarily done in Kabul and by foreign entities, without considering the actual needs of the people. Health centers were built in a few districts of the province, but permanent human resources and budget were not provided for them. The projects were seemingly completed but closed down after a few months. This dependence on external decisions made the local government feel powerless to manage independently.|Practical recommendations for the future based on my personal experiences. Aid should be managed and monitored thru local councils, namely Jirgas and Development Councils, not just from Kabul or foreign institutions. Local people should have a direct role in all stages, from planning to consumption. The reason is that in projects where the people of Ghor were involved in decision-making, such as some national solidarity and citizenship programs, there was less corruption and the work was actually completed. However, in projects where decisions were made in Kabul or by foreigners, more funds were wasted and there was no accountability.\n",

A local institution must be involved beforehand. One of the failures in the reconstruction of Afghanistan was the focus on institutions and organizations in Kabul, while neglecting local needs. Many projects were designed without consulting local people, which did not address their needs, and there was also a lack of transparency in project implementation. The creation of local councils led to people feeling a sense of ownership, and the decision was correct, with satisfactory results.

Mr. Fazli had studied nursing and did not have the understanding and knowledge of a large and important structure like the Presidential Affairs Department. Their selection was based on ethnicity and proximity to Ghani.|Aid and funding organizations for Afghan projects have always complained about corruption within the structures and were well aware of its widespread presence. The majority of Afghanistan's development projects were supported by the international community and implemented by state-owned companies, which were not executed properly due to wasted project budgets, leading to low project quality. For example, the Kabul-Kandahar road was built with low-quality materials and was very inefficient, deteriorating sooner than the standard they had set.|Ghani had a dual perspective. In its own ethnic structure, there was no problem with local councils. The Jirga somehow saw itself as the guarantor of power's firmness, but the ethnic, local organizations and ethnic Jirgas of other ethnic groups were seen as a threat to its power, and it said, \"We can no longer tolerate the 'island of power'.\" The reason for Ghani's conflict with other ethnic groups caused people not to support Ghani's government and further widened the gap between the government and the nation.

B) was influenced by ethnic bias and resulted in failure.

    "ID_S2_016|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|During the rule of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan under Presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, senior officials served who prioritized national interests over ethnic, partisan, and religious interests. A prime example of this could be the extension of the security agreement between the Afghan government and NATO, which resulted in national security and national interests being guarantyd for a specific period. In contrast, a limited number of party leaders working within the government structure prioritized ethnic interests over national interests, and their ethnic policies widened divisions among the people, ultimately undermining national unity. Political parties active in Afghanistan were operating with an expanding ethnic agenda to attract supporters and win elections. Parties should not have considered ethnic, regional, linguistic, religious, or other factors that harm national interests and unity as criteria for their activities. As a result, division among the people increased and hopes for a bright future diminished. Afghanistan's credibility with the international community diminished and international aid was limited. Because most of these aids were misused by these individuals, and the path to Afghanistan's growth and development was challenged.|One sector that did not yield positive results due to widespread administrative corruption was Afghanistan's education sector. Due to the existence of ghost schools and teachers, most of the government's money and budget was embezzled by ministers and senior officials. Cases of administrative corruption in Afghan courts speak to the widespread corruption and lack of transparency. International aid, without effective accountability from ministry leaders, led to delays in the delivery of international assistance and a decline in the quality of education in the country.|International aid provided to Afghanistan should have been implemented in full coordination with the local people thru beneficial projects. Most areas of Afghanistan lack access to safe water, and projects implemented by international NGOs like DACAAR to improve access to safe water often faced implementation difficulties due to local conflicts. Every village or location wanted to implement these projects in their areas, but due to budget constraints, it was difficult for the aid received to reach all vulnerable areas. In many cases, local people prevented the implementation of foreign projects due to security concerns and the activities of armed opponents in their areas. In some cases, these issues were resolved in coordination with local CDC councils, and the local people provided specific conditions to allow these projects to be adapted. For example, the water supply project in Badakhshan and Kunar provinces, which were insecure and had limited access to the government, was implemented with the advice and coordination of local councils because these were humanitarian aid and did not pursue political goals, so the local people allowed the implementation. In conflict-ridden areas, there are widespread disputes over water sources, including the legal ownership of these water resources, which is contested by local people. This has caused project implementation to be delayed or halted.|On the one hand, foreign aid played a very important and vital role for the Afghan government and people in the post-civil war period. However, most of this aid was implemented without oversight and at the discretion of the donor countries, and the Afghan people were unaware of the amount of this aid and how it was spent. Civil activists have mostly expressed their concern that the lack of transparency in the use of domestic budgets and international aid undermines the effectiveness of these contributions. In some cases, donor countries often prioritized their national interests over foreign aid. For example, the aid provided by the Iranian government to the office of Hamid Karzai's government was due to American political and military competition, and they demanded their interests in return for this aid from the Afghan government. The aid that the Indian government continued to provide for the development of Afghanistan was aimed at weakening Pakistan's regional role in the Afghan issue. These factors, which exacerbated regional conflict and competition with neighboring countries, ultimately had a significant impact on national interests and security.|The main recommendation for improving international aid delivery by the global community is to provide transparent mechanisms for implementing these projects so that accountability for these projects is clear to the people. This aid should be under the direct supervision of the people, and the basic priorities of the people should be considered in the preparation of development plans. Afghanistan is in dire need of international aid. Afghanistan is not a poor country and is not in dire need of international aid. The government cannot handle this humanitarian crisis alone, and the international community must continue its assistance. Foreign aid provided by international aid organizations did not reduce poverty in the country due to a lack of transparency, and public distrust of this aid increased. Afghanistan is still an economically weak country, and according to international statistics, Afghanistan faces a harsh winter, making a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan still possible. In order for foreign institutional aid to be effectively implemented in the country, an effective accountability mechanism must be established in coordination with the government, civil society, and people's representatives so that this aid can be effectively implemented and Afghanistan can potentially achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n",

If we assume this statement is correct and disregard the existence of a concept called \"leader\" in Afghanistan, and consider an action that transcends one's nationality, we can cite the recognition of education by private institutions in the country as an effective measure. This decision was made and implemented by President Karzai and, in my opinion, is considered one of the lasting and historic actions for the country.| Very clearly and openly, Afghanistan is considered one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This incorrect historical pattern has a history dating back to the country's contemporary era, but it reached its peak during the decade of democracy. It's very difficult to provide an example of corruption! You might think that if there was so much widespread corruption, why would it be difficult to find such an example? The answer is that in all government projects, corruption was considered part of the job and was so institutionalized that no work could be considered exempt from corruption. Therefore, I mention the Ministry of Public Health's health project as an example. In the implementation of this important project, corruption was rampant and multi-faceted, which both delayed the project's completion and led to the ineffective use of international community aid.|One of the fundamental problems in Afghanistan is the conflict between tradition and modernity. This conflict manifests itself in various forms, sometimes as the government versus traditional society, and at other times in other forms such as modern education and schools, and so on. A large portion of unfinished projects and actions have been due to this conflict. If you look at the annual budget codes, you'll notice that a large portion of the allocated budgets hasn't been used. When you investigate the reason, you'll find that the local people have prevented the project from being implemented, saying it doesn't align with our traditions and customs. Specifically, I can mention the non-implementation of school construction projects in Khost and Logar provinces.|The Geneva meetings and the setting of 21 indicators by donors directly subordinated Afghanistan's policymaking and budget to foreign priorities. Instead of genuine reform, the government manipulated figures and engaged in a superficial fight against corruption to maintain the flow of aid. This process eliminated independent decision-making, institutionalized financial dependence, and sacrificed national interests for the sake of continued foreign aid.|Aid should be spent 100% thru the national budget and under local community oversight, rather than directly injecting currency and creating dependency, and the focus should be on strengthening domestic capacities.

The municipality and land administration did not allow people to build here, but people started construction by paying money or using their connections with members of parliament or high-ranking officials of official institutions. However, this institution was unable or unwilling to solve the people's problems at their root, and now, with nearly a thousand homes built, they still lack municipal deeds and maps, and the government considers this land its own.

For example, it wants to provide low-interest loans to individuals in the agricultural sector or other businesses. If these individuals are successful, they will be given more loans or their interest will be waived so that people are encouraged to solve their own problems instead of always relying on aid.\n",
    "ID_S2_020|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|President Hamid Karzai's 2013 decision to jointly recruit young people from different ethnic groups to expand the national army is an example where national interests were prioritized over ethnic interests, resulting in a relatively positive outcome. Conversely, the decisions of some politicians during the 2019-2020 elections, which were based on ethnic biases, led to unsuccessful outcomes. a) National interests take precedence over ethnic interests - positive example • Background: From 2011 to 2014, the security situation in Afghanistan was poor and the withdrawal of international forces had been announced. It was necessary for the army and national police to be able to defend the entire country. • Action: Hamid Karzai announced a program to expand the national army, under which young people from different ethnic groups were recruited jointly. The recruitment process was intentionally designed to represent all of Afghanistan instead of a specific ethnic group. • Result: A relative balance was created in the camp's structure, which strengthened the sense of national identity and increased its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. Although problems remained, this decision reflected a transnational vision. b) Decision based on ethnic preferences – a failed example • Background: In the 2019-2020 elections, there was intense competition among political groups. Some high-ranking officials were making decisions to appease their ethnic supporters. • Action: Some politicians, whose support was based on ethnicity, opposed the election results and declared a parallel government. Instead of supporting transparent trends and national unity, decisions became subject to ethnic preferences. • Result: A legitimacy crisis was created, public trust in the government decreased, and the ground was prepared for the Taliban to regroup. This is a clear example of the negative consequences of a lack of national vision.|The Kabul Bank case – a clear example of corruption • Background: Kabul Bank was the largest private bank in Afghanistan and was used to pay salaries and finance development projects. International aid and government financial programs were primarily channeled thru this bank. • Action: Between 2010 and 2013, senior bank officials and individuals close to the government illegally withdrew approximately billion for personal gain. This corruption occurred thru fake loans, personal expenses, and funding political networks. • Result: Projects were halted: Educational and health projects whose salaries and budgets were paid thru Kabul Bank were delayed for several months. The quality of services decreased: Teachers and doctors were unable to continue working due to not receiving their salaries, and the quality of educational and health services declined. Cutting off foreign aid: International partners, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF), suspended aid programs to Afghanistan until the government takes serious action against corruption. By October 2012, only a small portion of the stolen money had been recovered, severely damaging global trust. Consonance obstacle (harmony) • This case showed that corruption is not just a domestic problem, but also erodes the trust of international partners. • The cessation and cutting of aid destroyed the atmosphere of cooperation between the government and the world and became a major obstacle to development projects. Result: The Kabul Bank scandal is a clear answer to this question: corruption causes project delays, reduces service quality, and cuts off foreign aid. This experience proves that the lack of transparency and accountability is the biggest obstacle to coordinating development programs.|The gap between formal and traditional institutions • Province: Helmand • Problem: Conflict over water resources (Helmand River water division) Explanation :In Helmand province, the water distribution problem worsened due to poor cooperation between government agencies and traditional local councils. • Background: The Helmand River's seawater is of vital importance for agriculture. There was no coordination between the government's official programs and the traditional decisions of the local elders. • Result: Water disputes increased, some areas faced water scarcity, and agricultural production decreased. The lack of joint decision-making between formal and traditional institutions hindered problem-solving. Positive control sample • Province: Nangarhar • Problem: Property dispute • Result: Due to effective cooperation between the state court and the local jirga, the land dispute was resolved jointly and both parties accepted the decision. Result: These examples show that when there is no cooperation (like in Helmand), conflicts are prolonged. But when cooperation is effective (like in Nangarhar), the problem is solved relatively successfully.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic autonomy . Example: The 2013-2015 security strategy, which was based on US and NATO assistance. Background • Due to the withdrawal of international forces (2014), the Afghan government was forced to design a large part of its security strategy and budget based on US and NATO aid. • The priority of global war contributors with the Taliban was to help and maintain major cities, not to create widespread local stability. Action • The focus of the national security strategy was placed on cities and highways, as requested by global partners. • Security funding was reduced for remote areas because donors controlled resource allocation according to their own priorities. Negative consequences • Contrary to national interests: The government's need was to secure the villages, but due to external pressure, security was only concentrated in the cities. • Result: The Taliban's influence in remote areas increased. The government's legitimacy decreased. Instead of long-term stability, a short-term defensive strategy was formed that was at odds with national interests. Result: This example shows that when national policy is subject to the priorities of foreign donors, the government's strategic independence is weakened, and the outcome is detrimental to national interests.|Practical advice for the future. Recommendation: Aid should be spent thru the \"national single budget,\" but under the transparent oversight of local people and with independent accountability mechanisms. How to make it practical • 1. National Unified Budget Framework: All global aid must be spent thru the official government budget, not thru separate donor projects. This prevents the creation of parallel offices and ensures coordination with national programs. • 2. Local Monitoring: At the provincial and district levels, people's councils or civil society organizations should monitor the implementation of projects. This reduces corruption and increases public trust. • 3. Independent Accounting: A common accounting system should be established for the use of aid, involving the government, global donors, and civil society. Reasons based on failures • During the reconstruction of Afghanistan, much of the aid was spent outside the government budget, resulting in: or creating parallel offices, or weakening the government's legitimacy, the increase in corruption, and the loss of public trust. Reasons based on successes • Projects implemented thru national budgets and under public supervision (such as some rural development projects) were relatively successful because people considered them \"their own projects.\" Result: To succeed in war-torn countries, aid must be channeled solely thru the national budget and be spent under public oversight and an independent accounting system. This framework prevents corruption, strengthens government legitimacy, and increases public trust.\n",
    "ID_S2_021|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|In the previous government, for example, we had leaders who acted beyond ethnic and linguistic issues and beyond political affiliations, and they achieved positive results from their work. In the example in the \"Integrity\" section, we can cite the Minister of Public Health, Ferozuddin Feroz. Dr. Ferozuddin Feroz acted transnationally, transethnically, and transsectorally in the field of public health, achieving very positive results in the Ministry of Public Health and the health sector. These positive actions led to him being recognized as the best Minister of Public Health in the world.|In the widespread corruption that was known as one of the factors in the previous government, we can give a specific example: the discussion about one of the development projects in Charikar city, Parwan province. Widespread corruption among parliamentary lawyers and local strongmen caused the project to be halted. The concrete and asphalt paving project was for the Charikar city intersection, which is known as the same intersection of resistance. Here, the local strongmen pressured the international body or institution that was the donor for this project, demanding that our share be paid. The same company and the same institution that was the project implementer stopped the project, and it finally reached the point where, after 2021, during the Taliban's rule, the project was completed.|Foreign aid weakens the strategic decisions of the government and the nation because relying on foreign aid stifles initiative and makes us solely dependent on international and foreign assistance and cooperation. That's why we can't choose our own initiative and a correct perspective. For example, US aid and equipment for the training and education of the national army, which was entirely dependent on them, did not benefit the people much, and ultimately, the forces they deployed, Units 01 and 02, were deployed by them based on strategic decisions and plans that the government had not prepared or trained for, and ultimately, the US government took them with them. He took them with him, calling them his created and trained forces, not because they were being used effectively in Afghanistan's security affairs.|Afghanistan should have a thorough situation analysis based on impartial monitoring and surveys. Based on the analysis results and the situation, aid should be pledged to Afghanistan and transferred to Afghanistan thru Afghanistan's own national budget, and the use of this budget in Afghanistan should be monitored to prevent corruption in its expenditure. In other words, the institution or donor that is cooperating, or the international community itself, should closely monitor how its cooperation is being used. This is how monetary and financial corruption is prevented and a positive change is brought about in the work process.|\n",
    "ID_S2_022|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|A clear example of both states can be found during the Republic era (2011-2021). For example, we can recall Ashraf Ghani's decision to sign a security agreement with the United States, which he stated aimed to prioritize national interests over ethnic interests. Karzai refused to sign the treaty, but Hanif Atmar, the then foreign minister, signed the treaty on behalf of Ashraf Ghani in 2014. After the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the debate over signing a \"Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA)\" with the United States was heated. Hamid Karzai refused to sign it, considering it contrary to national independence. However, at the beginning of the National Unity Government, despite political pressure from various ethnic factions, Ashraf Ghani decided to sign it. Ashraf Ghani stated that the purpose of this action was to ensure the survival of the government structure and security forces, maintain financial aid, and prevent a security vacuum. Many Pashtun-centric figures within the government and Karzai's circle opposed it by signing, but Ghani called it a \"national necessity.\" After signing this agreement, Western financial and military support for the Afghan government continued until 2021, and the Nano mission to assist and equip the national army continued. The signing of this treaty strengthened the international legitimacy of the Afghan government. Although this decision sparked criticism, it was a rare example of prioritizing national interests (in line with the survival of the republican system and the country's security) despite ethnic and political pressures, and it had positive short-term results. It is worth mentioning that Rahmatullah Nabil (former head of national security) also opposed political and ethnic pressures multiple times during his tenure as head of national security (2014-2016) and emphasized strengthening national and non-ethnic structures within the intelligence services. His opposition to the release of some Taliban figures, particularly due to political and ethnic pressures, was a sign of prioritizing national interests over ethnic interests. Nabil's resignation in protest against Ashraf Ghani's personal and discriminatory policies (during his visit to Pakistan) was a sign of his nationalist stance. b) Ethnically biased and exclusionary decisions (2017-2020). During Ashraf Ghani's second term as president, appointments in security institutions – particularly the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the National Directorate of Security – took on a distinctly ethnic flavor. Many commanders and governors were appointed based on the criterion of \"ethnic loyalty,\" regardless of their professional and technical competence. for example, in 2018, Ashraf Ghani appointed General Tariq Shah Bahrami (affiliated with a specific ethnic circle) as Minister of Defense instead of Abdullah Habibi. These changes, along with the gradual removal of Tajik and Uzbek commanders from security structures, sparked strong political reactions in the north of the country. This displacement weakened cohesion within the security forces and widened the gap between the northern forces and the central government. These decisions also undermined trust within the resistance fronts against the Taliban, ultimately leading to the rapid fall of provinces in 2021 as a result of the collapse of the chain of command and lack of coordination among the forces. This type of ethnocentric decision-making was an example of ethnic interests overriding national interests, which led to the weakening of the security structure and the collapse of the republican system. At the end of his second term, instead of strengthening national institutions, Hamid Karzai (President until 2014) strengthened a network of ethnic and local commanders to maintain his ethnic influence in the south of the country. In appointing governors and security officials, he prioritized ethnic balance over merit, and instead of strengthening \"nation-building,\" he pursued a policy of \"ethnic appeasement\" to ensure his political survival. These decisions of his had bad consequences and It rooted the culture of ethnic dealing in the government structure and passed it on to the next government. It then became clear that these Karzai programs were steps toward paving the way for the Taliban, until Ghani completed Karzai's unfinished mission by handing over the Arg to the Taliban. Amrullah Saleh (Ashraf Ghani's first deputy and former national security chief), despite his anti-terrorism and nationalist record, spoke from an ethnic perspective in the final years of his cooperation with Ghani, contributing to the polarization of the political atmosphere. Also, some of his statements and positions on social media, instead of emphasizing \"national convergence,\" sometimes took on an ethnic and linguistic tone. Such positions reduced the capacity for national unity within the anti-Taliban resistance front in the final days of the Republic.|No response|A clear example of this type of project can be explained in Nangarhar province, where the dispute was over water distribution in the Serekan (Spin Ghar) district. Between 2016 and 2019, the dispute between the farmers of two villages over the distribution of water from the \"Kameh\" irrigation canal intensified due to a lack of coordination between the Nangarhar Water Basin Department and local councils. Because the government had changed the canal route without consulting local influentials, local conflicts erupted and agricultural lands remained dry for several months. In contrast, a project in Bamyan province can be mentioned where the dispute over the boundary of agricultural lands in the village of \"Shiber\" (2018-2019) was resolved thru dialog. In this case, close cooperation between the Bamyan Department of Agriculture and local elders led to the establishment of a mediation committee, resolving the dispute peacefully thru dialog.|A specific example of this project was the decision-making process regarding the implementation of the \"TAPI\" project (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline) around the years 2015-2021, with the Asian Development Bank and the government of Turkmenistan as donors. Explanation: The Afghan government, under pressure and encouragement from foreign donors, especially the Asian Development Bank, prioritized the advancement of the TAPI project to be recognized as a regionally supported energy transit route. However, in practice, insecurity along the project route and the lack of guarantyd real benefits for the people of Afghanistan led to national investment in domestic energy infrastructure (such as electricity generation from northern gas or domestic dams) being overlooked. The failure of this project to materialize had negative consequences. This project never materialized, diverting government attention from more urgent domestic projects, increasing Afghanistan's political dependence on regional countries; as a result, Afghanistan's national interests were sacrificed to the geopolitical priorities of the donors.|Aid should be 100% channeled thru the government's national budget and monitored by the local people, not thru separate donor projects. Practical advice: In any post-war reconstruction program, before allocating funds and starting projects, a \"tripartite partnership structure\" must be established between the central government, local institutions, and civil society to ensure joint decision-making on priorities and monitoring of implementation. One successful example of this project was the Citizen Covenant program. In the \"Citizenship Covenant\" program (2016-2020), when village development councils participated in decision-making about small projects (such as roads or schools), the projects were implemented on time and with quality. However, in projects that were planned solely by ministries or foreign donors (such as some World Bank projects in the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development), work either stopped or the quality decreased due to local distrust and administrative corruption. This poor quality of projects will be resolved when they have genuine participation. This showed that without the genuine participation of the people and local leaders in design and monitoring, no foreign aid, even if it amounts to billions of dollars, will be sustainable or used effectively.\n",
    "ID_S2_023|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|Multinational countries and diverse societies need leaders who have a national and transnational vision to facilitate peaceful coexistence among all ethnic groups and various socio-political groups in light of the country/society's prevailing laws. My visit, along with that of former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, with the perspective of prioritizing ethnic interests, paved the way in 2021 for the downfall of a legitimate, inclusive government in favor of a specific ethnic group (the Taliban), both of whom are from the same ethnic background (Pashtun). He removed experienced and influential individuals from the ranks of the security forces and civil positions, gradually handed over districts to the Taliban one after another, and finally brought an end to the 20-year Republic with his own escape.|Many international partners were involved in the corruption of high-ranking Afghan officials, and in many cases, they prevented their prosecution by judicial and legal institutions. In my opinion, the hypothesis that widespread corruption was the main obstacle to cooperation between the government and international partners is incorrect. On the contrary, high-ranking government officials and most of their international partners were complicit in widespread corruption, including the law, police, judiciary, prosecution, parliament, and the military. Everything was under the control of this corrupt gang; there was no second authority to hold them accountable, and everyone was in cahoots. I have personally seen dozens of infrastructure projects that, despite consuming huge sums of money, have not lasted due to poor quality and are currently unusable.|One of the main reasons for the lack of institutionalization of laws in Afghanistan's various systems has been these traditional tribal structures, and in many cases, despite the clarity of the law, disputes were resolved by local elders, which often resulted in injustice in the decisions of local councils and tribal elders' assemblies. Traditional and tribal structures have never been supportive of the rule of law in the country; on the contrary, these structures have weakened the law.|Exactly, governments dependent on foreign aid are not independent in their decision-making. For example: The extraction of the Aynak copper mine in Logar province was awarded by the then government to a Chinese company, but due to the disagreements and conflicts between China and Western countries, led by the United States, and because the Chinese company was also the financial backer of the then government, the extraction of this national project was not allowed to be realized, and the government was obliged to follow the policies and guidelines of the United States.|Not all countries are in the same state after a war; some may need to rebuild buildings, roads, bridges, and highways. However, some of these countries may have a serious need and priority for education, promoting the rule of law, strengthening national unity, raising citizens' knowledge levels, avoiding violence, and so on. Okay. In any case, international aid should be distributed and used thru the government institutions of the war-torn country with international supervision.\n",

The Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Directorate, without consulting the village council and local elders, decided to change the water distribution route in the secondary canal to help the new irrigation project. Local leaders and the local council considered this decision unilateral and contrary to the previous agreement, and prevented its implementation. The government was also unable to implement the decision without local support. Result : The channel remained closed for about two months. Agricultural lands in both villages were dry and damaged. Physical and armed clashes occurred between young people from two villages, and several people were injured. The issue was only temporarily resolved after a joint council was formed between the government and local elders.|It is clear that non-discretionary budgets (foreign aid) have a negative impact on the independent decision-making of government institutions. A specific answer will be provided below. Decision Topic: Increasing the size of security forces beyond the country's financial capacity Time: 2011-2014. Effective Donor: United States and NATO. Area: Security Policy and National Budget. Following the Chicago and Tokyo conferences, international donors, particularly the United States, emphasized the rapid increase in the number of Afghan security forces (army and police) to approximately 352,000 personnel. This decision was based more on NATO's military objectives than on an assessment of Afghanistan's economic and administrative capacity. Why was it against national interests? The Afghan government had warned that the national budget could not afford to pay the salaries, logistics, and maintenance of this number of troops, but accepted the proposal due to its dependence on foreign aid. Negative consequences: Creating strong financial dependence; over 90% of security expenditures were paid for by foreign aid. After aid was reduced in the years 1398-1400, livelihoods and equipping units faced difficulties. Inability to maintain expensive equipment and aircraft that could only be operated by foreign specialists. Decreased morale and the collapse of the command structure in the final months of the regime.|The intervention of the international community should be contingent on non-interference in political and economic decision-making.

    "ID_S2_025|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|: A) In short and concise terms, a decision by a senior Afghan government official that prioritized national interests over ethnic interests, and which had positive results, led the government to decide in the years 2011-2021 to implement the important infrastructure project of constructing a major highway that begins at the Kabul axis and ends in Bamyan and Daikundi, as well as along the Baghlan route, which connects the aforementioned provinces to the center of Kabul, based on national priorities. Despite political and ethnic pressures to divert funds to specific routes and regions, the project was implemented in accordance with public needs and national interests. The importance of this project was that it connected several central and northern provinces of Afghanistan with each other and with the capital. Result: - Transportation routes and the movement of merchants' goods between the aforementioned provinces were facilitated, and costs were reduced. - Public satisfaction increased, and people's trust in the government and the ruling system grew. - This project was one of the national projects in the decade (2010-2020) that was implemented regardless of ethnic affiliation. - The connection of the Herat, Badghis, Faryab, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Ghazni routes, where people from the mentioned regions live with different ethnicities and languages, has connected their network, which demonstrates effective leadership free from ethnic interests. - Result: Positive, and its consequences: - Connecting important central, northern, and western provinces, reducing travel costs and facilitating travel for passengers, transporting goods, and increasing trade between provinces. - Widespread public satisfaction and increased trust between the people of the provinces and the center emerged. -Note: If you wish, you can also consider the road network and the connection of the Bamyan, Yakawlang-Kotel-e Qonaq-Nili (the center of Daikundi) and Jaghori routes as part of this large national network. B) Making a decision that was influenced by ethnic bias and had an unsuccessful and ineffective outcome: During the period 2011-2021, actions and measures were taken in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health based on ethnic tendencies, network affiliation, and group affiliation, which: - In the Ministry of Education and Health, appointments and placements of individuals in key positions were made based on ethnic and group affiliation, while specialized and experienced staff were sidelined and individuals lacking experience and expertise were appointed to important and key positions. - In the years 2016-2018, official reports from Faryab, Paktia, Logar, and Takhar provinces showed that: - School construction and textbook printing projects were delayed due to poor management and corruption. - The books were not distributed on time. - Corruption in contracts increased. - Some donor-funded projects were canceled. - This is a clear example of decision-making failure influenced by bias.|Widespread corruption clearly had negative effects on international projects. There are specific examples of projects being delayed due to corruption. The National Rural Water Supply Program project in Uruzgan and Helmand provinces from 2014-2016, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in collaboration with the World Bank, carried out rural water supply projects. According to information (reports) from Uruzgan and Helmand: - Local contractors embezzled part of the budget. - The drilling quality was unsatisfactory, and the water tank preparation was of poor quality. - The financial documents lacked transparency. Result: The World Bank halted the project for several months, and thousands of families were left without access to clean water. Reduced service quality: Health programs in the Ministry of Public Health, in 2017, in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, and Farah, reported that health implementing companies had illegally withdrawn a portion of the budget, which resulted in: - Clinics were left without medicine or medical supplies. - Employe salaries haven't been paid for months. - Maternal and child mortality increased, and the quality of health service delivery severely declined and even collapsed. - Cutting off foreign aid due to corruption: The printing and publication of textbooks in the Ministry of Education in 1397 (solar year) was supported by international donors, especially the European Union. After the exposure of corruption in the printing and publication contracts for hundreds of thousands of textbooks for education students, the following decisions were made: - They completely cut off the budget that had been allocated. - The project's execution was halted pending complete reviews. - Millions of students were unable to receive books in the next academic year. - The Ministry of Education's credibility was questioned and the level of trust in it decreased significantly.|The effects of the gap between formal and traditional institutions. There are clear examples where projects have faced difficulties in implementation due to poor cooperation between formal and traditional institutions. In Baghlan Province - Burka District: Problems and conflicts over the distribution of irrigation canal water in 2015. Without coordinating or consulting with local elders, the government implemented a new water distribution plan. This action resulted in: - Two villages entered into conflict and dispute. - Several acres of land were destroyed. - The canal improvement project was halted for several months. Matters that have been resolved correctly and effectively due to effective cooperation between formal and traditional institutions: In Herat Province, Injil District: Problems and disputes arose between the two families (tribes) regarding irrigated lands. To resolve this issue, the government, in collaboration with the local council, the tribal jirga, the land authorities, held joint meetings and sessions, which resulted in: - The conflict was resolved non-violently. - The land was officially registered by the government. - The irrigation project that was beyond was implemented without any problems.|How foreign aid affects the government's independent decision-making. A) Supportive effects on government decision-making: In the years 2011-2016, the United States and NATO insisted and emphasized the implementation of development budgets in the security sector. Donors insisted that more budget be spent on creating security forces, building bases, and equipping the police. The government was forced to: - Transfer a large portion of development budget from economic and infrastructure projects to security-focused (security) projects. B) Negative consequences and repercussions (contrary to national interests) that resulted in the following: - Economic projects (road construction, energy, agriculture) were underfunded and poorly developed. - The level of economic growth decreased and slowed down. - The country's dependence on foreign aid increased. - It created public dissatisfaction with the lack of development services.|Practical recommendations for the future (Framework for assistance) Based on the lessons learned over the years and real-world experience in Afghan society, how should it be and what should be done? Based on past experiences, it is suggested that international aid to Afghanistan (a post-conflict country) be implemented in a hybrid model. How? - 50% of the aid will be implemented and operationalized thru the national government budget, under the supervision of an independent body, civil society councils, and the media. - 50% of the aid will be implemented thru independent donor projects to reduce the risks of politicization and corruption. Perhaps we can find an example of this model in the Citizen Contract Program (CCNPP), where local community monitoring led to greater transparency and trust. It is also worth noting that at the same time and during that era, the helpers maintained their technical roles, which had a positive outcome.\"\"\"\n",

    "ID_S1_004|10/25/2025 4:19:02|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|2016–2021|After 2001, it was essential for any Afghan leader to enjoy comprehensive rule and strategic legitimacy. First, comprehensive rule was necessary to pursue the unification of Afghanistan's religions, ethnicities, and tribes into a single state and national identity. Years of violent conflict had torn apart the fabric of Afghan society, and almost everywhere in Afghanistan, the risk of destruction from political unrest was higher than usual. Only through leadership that embraces power sharing and representation can Afghanistan hope to achieve a certain level of political stability and social cohesion. Second, as much as reestablishing state authority will be part of the maturation of the Afghan state, strategic legitimacy locally, regionally, and globally will be fundamental to this transformation. Domestic legitimacy has been based on two main objectives: responding to citizens' needs and providing a minimum level of services, and respecting Islamic and traditional values, which are also important elements of domestic legitimacy. Restoring international legitimacy and gaining a certain level of diplomatic credibility requires some ability to counter foreign influence and address negative perceptions of living under the tutelage of external actors and their sovereign powers. Without a legitimate foundation, any government risks being seen as an external power transfer, and the absence of legitimacy undermines any progress toward long-term stability.|Afghan leaders have made progress, but they also have to deal with ongoing challenges in bringing together formal government institutions and traditional institutions like the Loya Jirga and local councils. Programs such as the Loya Jirga and the National Solidarity Program have involved local leaders in some decision-making and development initiatives, although they have not always been effective. In many locations, local loyalties, instability, and lack of government capacity have made it difficult to fully integrate these systems.|Heavy reliance on foreign funding and technical assistance hampered the development of self-reliant and accountable strategic thinking among Afghan leaders, as donors predetermined or influenced a large portion of the budget and major projects. As a result, leaders generally felt compelled to prioritize donor commitments over national priorities. This, in turn, fostered a dependency mindset that stifled initiative and weakened local accountability, as success came to be defined more by satisfying foreign partners than by addressing the realities faced by Afghan citizens.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Neutral|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Neutral|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|Aside from the financial situation, the significant weakness affecting service delivery and policy implementation was the limited capability and expertise in government institutions. Many ministries and local offices did not have qualified staff, systems, or coordination, which ultimately created significant obstacles to mobilize plans into action. This affected timeliness, productivity, and public frustrations across all sectors, including health, education, and infrastructure. |Inability to provide security|An example is Afghanistan's National Solidarity Program (NSP), which empowered people at the community level through Community Development Councils. By engaging with local elders and taking into account customary decision-making processes, the program was culturally appropriate and unearthed community priorities delivering educational, transportation, and water infrastructure. Conversely, programs that did not respect cultural contexts were likely to be rejected by communities, underscoring the critical importance of cultural appropriateness in programming.|The key takeaway from 2001-2021 is that effective and acceptable governance is not created just from external funding or external institutions; it has to be central to local political reality and social trust. In Afghanistan, efforts were primarily centered on creating a formal structure and the institution needed to satisfy donor expectations, yet when institutions lacked legitimacy to traditional leadership, customary practices, and citizen need, they were often presented an illusion of legitimacy. Sustainable governance requires a balance between contemporary state institutions and local authority, security, the provision of basic services, and accountability grounded in the people themselves.|Not provided\n",

People continued to view local solutions as more credible and fair than resorting to official channels.|The most important lesson of this course is that effective and legitimate governance is sustainable when its political and social ownership arises from within the society, not imposed from without. In a country like Afghanistan, legitimacy does not come from the ballot box or international support alone; it requires internal consensus, coherence with the cultural and social context, transparency, and genuine participation of the people in decision-making. Governance is strengthened when formal state structures, local community values, and traditional institutions are connected; stability and legitimacy are undermined when this connection is ignored.|Yes! An important point that has been less addressed is the importance of institutional continuity in the process of state-building in Afghanistan. Experience has shown that extensive, accelerated, and person-centered changes in leadership, diplomacy, and government structures have caused no policy or program to survive. In the absence of continuity, capacities were not accumulated, historical memory was not formed, and each government effectively started from scratch. In my opinion, if policies and institutions had structural stability, a culture of accountability, and a program-centered approach, many domestic and international efforts in the path of state-building in Afghanistan would have had more lasting and effective results.\n",

    "ID_S1_012|10/26/2025 17:36:30|Former Afghan Government Official|2011–2015, 2016–2021|In my opinion, given Afghanistan's unique characteristics, not only over the past 20 years but also in the future, an effective leader can only be effective if, as a first step, they have a cross-ethnic vision for the country and consider Afghanistan to be connected to and dependent on all of its ethnic groups. Second, they must be specialized. To overcome and properly manage the crisis, they must assemble a team of experts to organize matters with complete competence, experience, and understanding. In short, a cross-ethnic vision and a specialized, experience-centered vision are essential characteristics of an effective leader in Afghanistan.|Afghan leaders managed to build relationships between official institutions and traditional structures to some extent, but this balance was unstable. For example, during the reigns of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, the Loya Jirga councils were used for national decision-making, but no sustainable coordination with government institutions was established.|Unfortunately, Afghanistan was completely dependent on aid from the international community, and this total dependence meant that, in times of crisis and decision-making, the country's leaders were unable to make independent decisions based on the national interests of the country. As a result, the outcome and repercussions of this situation were exactly what the United States wanted.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Widespread corruption|I disagree with the lack of financial resources.

It is a very detailed story that cannot be described here.|I think the biggest lesson that can be learned is that if a country like Afghanistan wants to emerge from the crisis, they must be careful in choosing and appointing their leaders, they must vote for people who will work for Afghanistan, and in the second step, the priority of the leaders and all the people should be the collective interests of the country. We voted based on ethnic affiliations, the leaders decided based on their ethnic affiliations, and the result was that the country became more critical. The big lesson is to appoint people based on their competence, honesty, and expertise, not ethnic affiliations, language, etc. In short, post-conflict countries need competent and honest people who prioritize the interests of the country above everything else.|While recalling the issues mentioned above, the most important issue that is vital for Afghanistan is governance away from emotions; over the past few decades, we have tried to turn the country into a battlefield and a conflict between neighbors with emotional policies. Afghanistan will not develop unless a neighbor called Pakistan feels at ease with us. Strategic wisdom dictates that we observe moderation in our relations between India and Pakistan to protect ourselves from possible harm from Pakistan, which we have unfortunately not done so far.\n",
    "ID_S1_013|10/26/2025 17:42:03|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|2011–2015|In my opinion, the two most important qualities for an effective Afghan leader after 2001 were: 1. The ability to build national unity: After years of war and ethnic conflict, an effective leader must be able to build trust and solidarity among different groups, ethnicities, and religions in order to lay the foundations for a sustainable nation-state. 2. Commitment to transparency and fighting corruption: During the reconstruction period in Afghanistan, rampant corruption was one of the main challenges. A leader who emphasizes transparency, accountability, and justice is able to maintain the trust of the people and the international community and make the development process sustainable.|Unfortunately, customs and traditions still prevail in many parts of the country, and tribal values are paramount. On the other hand, during the 20-year republic, some outsiders did not believe in these customs and traditions, and some even showed an excessive desire to use them to polish their image in front of the public by respecting customs and traditions. In my opinion, the result of these trends was a more critical situation in the country. We have multifaceted crises and problems in the country that must be solved with modern science, a specialized perspective, and effective diplomacy, or at least a reasonable solution must be found for them. However, not only did we lack a logical and specialized perspective in this area, but we also wanted to solve the country's most sensitive problems through the Loya Jirga, a council whose members are mostly illiterate or have limited education. In fact, the country's constitution stipulates that the constitution can be amended through the Loya Jirga, although it has its own procedures. In my opinion, after 2001, Afghan leaders were only able to build effective bridges between official state institutions and traditional structures, such as local councils and jirgas, to a limited extent. On the one hand, attempts were made to use traditional structures in decision-making. For example, the 2003 Constitutional Loya Jirga, the Consultative Peace Jirga, and the Jirga for the Release of Taliban Prisoners in subsequent years were examples of using local traditions to legitimize national decisions. These councils helped people feel that they had a stake in the political process. On the other hand, in many cases, a gap remained between the central government and local structures. The government failed to integrate these traditional institutions into the formal system in a sustainable manner. As a result, government decisions were sometimes met with opposition or mistrust at the local level. In short, attempts were made to build links, but these links were not sustainable or institutionalized, and one of the main weaknesses in the Afghan state-building process remained.|Overreliance on international financial and technical assistance has had profound effects on the development of independent strategic thinking among Afghan leaders. On the one hand, this reliance has led to the country's overall planning and decision-making being influenced by the priorities, policies, and interests of donor countries, rather than the real needs of Afghan society. As a result, many leaders focused on attracting foreign support to seize power and manage aid resources, rather than on developing sustainable national strategies. On the other hand, this situation has weakened the culture of domestic accountability; when budgets and resources are mainly provided from abroad, leaders feel less pressure to be accountable to the people. In other words, they derived their legitimacy more from international support than from public satisfaction. As a result, excessive reliance on foreign aid has hindered the growth of intellectual independence, institutional self-sufficiency, and political accountability among the Afghan leadership.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not very effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Not effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, rampant corruption, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|In addition to a lack of financial resources, one of the most notable internal weaknesses of Afghan state institutions was their lack of effective administrative and organizational capacities, coupled with rampant corruption.

Leaders and government officials have attempted to use this method to make decisions that address the country's best interests. However, in modern governance, non-traditional institutions that are not formed on the basis of a social contract do not have sufficient authority and credibility to make major decisions at the national level. Leaders or political elites in Afghanistan, who were in fact the traditional leaders of society, believed in this method as a solution to major national problems. Before the Taliban came to power, Afghan governments often turned to consultative jirga councils to resolve national issues and even make decisions affecting their foreign policy.

    "ID_S1_022|10/28/2025 5:49:47|International Diplomat/Representative of an International Organization|2016–2021|After 2001, an effective Afghan leader must possess two important qualities: First, his clear leadership encourages the establishment of true peace—a leader who stands with his countrymen amid the destruction that has befallen his country and builds bridges between all nations in the hope of reconciliation. Second, he must be honest and accountable to his people—a leader who stands with his people, leads them through their pain, grief, and hopes, and leads them with honesty.|He believes that Afghan leaders have many ways to build an effective relationship between formal government institutions and traditional communities and structures. Most of the time, both systems were in a state of distrust. The executive branch of the high command spent a lot of time on energy, which was important to him. On the other hand, traditional and tribal councils are crowded with government officials, have elders who do not trust them, and are rife with political corruption. In addition, traditional and local councils are more isolated from the armed forces and the opposition. Some political leaders have tried, but unfortunately, their symbolic efforts have been short-lived. In the case of the Loya Jirga, a local jirga was formed, the debate was managed, and everything was symbolic of his policies. Overall, this relationship remained incomplete—neither traditional structures, nor formal government institutions, nor the trust of the people were strengthened.|I believe that the country has relied too heavily on foreign political leaders and financial and technical assistance, which has weakened Afghan leaders' sense of national responsibility and independent strategic thinking. When equipment is the last important part of the organization, we can clearly see how weak mid-level government managers are, as well as their independence, strategic thinking, and responsibility. The sense of ownership of the country and the government has been seriously damaged, and the country has become heavily dependent on foreigners and their financial and technical assistance. After 2016, many leaders tried to reduce dependence on the homeland and restore responsibility. Remember some examples. For example, in 2016, Americans seriously discussed strengthening the country's air force. Similarly, we have only 157 Black Hawk helicopters. The air force has received dozens of transport and large military equipment, giant fighter jets, fighter jets, and bombers. Every six months, dozens of young people in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Europe, and the United States receive training in the Air Force. For example, when the former president seriously discussed the Case Management System (CMS), he took the matter to the US Supreme Court. In front of millions of American citizens, biometric data and its transfer were discussed, the nationality of topographic information was discussed, security responsibilities were transferred, and he also had a lot of work under his control, but he did his best, did not feel ownership, relied on foreign countries, and ultimately paved the way for the fall.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Not effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Very effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries, security challenges, and lack of long-term strategic vision|I believe that the most serious impact is weak internal institutions, corruption, political interference, and weak capacity (capacity gap).

The Ministry of Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) launched the Afghan National Integration Program around 2003 with the help of the World Bank. This program aims to empower villagers to make decisions and develop and implement projects. De Biera's factors: 1. Social values of harmony: The Afghan Rural Council Program, the Jirga Council, and the Partnership should be established. The villagers chose the Shura Council (Village Development Council) and decided to implement the project (road, water, school, bridge, electricity, etc.). 2. Trust and sense of ownership among the people: When the people participated in decision-making, they felt that they were managing the project themselves, not the government or foreigners. Corruption became more difficult. 3. Gradual participation of women: In areas where traditional restrictions exist, the structure of women's councils should be introduced gradually and cautiously. Da Franji prevented conflict and paved the way for Kibledo. The result: more than 35,000 projects benefited from the National Solidarity Program, and thousands of small development projects improved people's lives. The Community Development Program of the World Bank and other institutions is a successful example.

This leader must have strategic leadership and the ability to make decisive decisions in order to pursue a clear strategy for the country's stability, security, and long-term economic growth. A close relationship with the people and a deep understanding of the nation's needs and values are also essential for a leader, as the trust of the people is the foundation of any legitimate system. In addition, the leader of international relations must have the ability to manage effectively, so that the national interests of Afghanistan and its international partners are protected in a balanced manner.|After 2001, the Afghan government leadership faced political and administrative complexities in achieving an effective balance between formal institutions and traditional community structures, namely jirgas and local councils. The political and social reality in Afghanistan shows that traditional structures of legitimacy, arbitration, and social order are based on historical provisions, while formal government institutions represent modern governance, accountability, and the rule of law. Although some leaders have attempted to integrate the two by establishing consultative councils, these efforts have often failed to achieve effective coordination and long-term action. For example, the adoption of the Loya Jirga constitution and the participation of the people is a symbolic example, and the decision itself has not been fully implemented at the political or administrative level of the Loya government. Overall, the efforts of Afghan leaders and formal and informal institutions to build an effective bridge have been limited because they do not appreciate traditions and structures. This should be recognized as an authentic form, not only in modern state-building, but also in line with the principles of a sustainable framework.|His analysis, leadership of Afghanistan, international financial and technical assistance, and heavy reliance on independent strategic thinking and responsiveness had a profound impact on the institution. This dependence has often forced leaders to follow the requirements and conditions of international donors, limiting their ability to make independent, long-term policy decisions. It will also weaken the culture of accountability, because decisions about responsibility and accountability will, in most cases, depend on foreign institutions and their expectations. In addition, reliance on foreign aid has also limited local innovation, capacity building, and national resources based on decision-making capacity, damaging the government's legitimacy and public confidence.|[Negotiating aid agreements]: Effective|[Coordination between donor countries and international institutions]: Not effective|[Aligning aid with Afghan national priorities (as opposed to donor priorities)]: Not effective|[Building trust and lasting partnerships]: Effective|Conflicting priorities and lack of coordination among donor countries|In addition to limited financial resources, limited human and administrative capacity in Afghan government institutions is one of the biggest internal obstacles that has had a profound impact on service delivery and policy implementation.

In addition, deficiencies in internal organizational structures, centralized decision-making, high centralization, lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms, and weak inter-agency coordination have prevented the effective implementation of policies.

In addition, local leaders, communities, and cultural sensitivities take into account the lack of diplomatic efforts and international cooperation and influence.

    "ID_S2_004|Former Afghan Government Official|During the years 2011-2021, President Ashraf Ghani made a clear decision to support the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Gas Pipeline Project (TAPI Pipeline Project). At that time, Afghanistan was facing serious economic problems, such as energy shortages and restrictions on regional trade. Ashraf Ghani emphasized the priority of national interests and considered the overall interests of the country to be superior to ethnic or regional interests. He actively participated in international negotiations, signed relevant agreements, and approved the necessary internal measures for pipeline construction, such as land use and route selection. Although the project is not yet complete, Ghani's decision has paved the way for the expansion of regional economic cooperation and the creation of job opportunities for the people of Afghanistan, and has given the country international economic credibility. This is an example where national interests took precedence over ethnic interests and had positive outcomes.|Direct experience from a road construction project in Parwan province in 2017 showed how administrative and financial corruption hinders coordination. During the implementation of the contracts for this project, some contracting companies did not properly adhere to road construction standards, and in some sections, only a thin layer of sand was used. According to reports from local people and the press, the project delays and poor road quality were linked to corruption, as contracts were often awarded in the names of influential individuals. As a result, not only was the road quality poor, but coordination between government agencies and international partners was also slow, and service delivery to local people was affected. This example illustrates how corruption can have a serious negative impact on project implementation, service quality, and the coordination system.|A long-standing water distribution problem in Laghman province of Afghanistan has worsened due to poor cooperation between official institutions and local leaders. The provincial Department of Agriculture tried to start the construction project of a canal, but a place for consultation with the local jirgas and councils was not selected.

The government agencies relied solely on administrative orders, without providing opportunities for trust and participation to local leaders. The outcome was that the project was delayed, water distribution conflicts increased, and public dissatisfaction grew. This example illustrates that coordination between formal and traditional structures plays a vital role in resolving local conflicts.|The police building program in Afghanistan is an example where foreign aid had a negative impact against national interests. A lot of money was spent by international donors to fund and equip the police, but not enough attention was given to managing and building the capacity of the Afghan government's security sector. This process weakened the Afghan government's sovereignty and was driven solely by foreign priorities, not based on Afghanistan's long-term security needs. As a result, there was an increase in police corruption and a weakening of the government system, which had consequences against national interests.|A practical recommendation for Afghanistan's reconstruction is that the international community should implement each aid project thru Afghanistan's national budget and national institutions, rather than having different projects managed by separate donors. This not only prevents the waste of resources but also helps strengthen the country's governmental capacities. A joint fund should be established for aid, with financial oversight and management thru the Ministry of Finance, and project monitoring given to representatives of the community and government. Project implementation should be based on the consultation and participation of local people to ensure their needs are met correctly and to increase project effectiveness. To this end, the transparency of all projects and the monitoring of results should be done thru financial and non-financial audits.

    "ID_S2_009|International Diplomat/Representative of an International Organization|Regarding the transnational leader: In 2020, I was working at the Ministry of Water and Energy as the Director of Water Affairs Regulation for the General Directorate of the Kabul River Basin. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, initiated a move to divide the Ministry of Water and Energy into two agencies: the National Water Affairs Regulatory Authority and the National Energy Affairs Regulatory Authority. From an administrative perspective, this was a positive and national act because Afghanistan produces approximately 75 billion cubic meters of water annually but is unable to utilize 20% of this total due to mismanagement. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a single agency for comprehensive management of water resources to control Afghanistan's water resources thru a strategic plan spanning approximately 5 years and 10 years. Part A: This was a positive step toward economic growth for the country, improving agriculture from the water infrastructure. Part B: This action by the president failed because the president had ethnic and personal motives for two reasons. First, he turned the ministry into an administration because he wanted to be allowed by the constitution to appoint anyone to head an administration without needing a vote from parliament to elect them. Secondly, according to the agreements of the unity government, the Ministry of Water and Energy belonged to Dr. Abdullah. How could he have his close associates in this ministry when he had turned the ministry into a management?|Corruption as an obstacle to coordination, there were two reasons for the president to carry out widespread corruption. First, he appointed someone close to him to head the administration, and thru this, he was able to implement the infrastructure projects for the imaginary water facilities and add their cost to his capital, which he almost did. Or, he contracted and implemented the infrastructure projects for the water facilities with several companies that were from his own people, and he did. I witnessed several projects; a small example of this was the maintenance and care of the Darunta Dam, which cost approximately 53 million Afghanis. This project was contracted by a company from his own people, and it can be said that this project was contracted for 25 million. Secondly, according to the law, the head of the administration was appointed by the president, and this head of the administration was accountable and reported to no one other than the president. Even Parliament, the embodiment of the people's will, did not have the authority to remove or hold them accountable.|Regarding the gap between the formal and dominant institutions, I must say that since the ministries and departments were restructured, the president, according to the constitution, had the authority to choose the head of the department himself. Parliament, which represented the people, had no vote or authority in this process. For this reason, a person close to power or with political influence was usually appointed to head the departments, rather than technical and expert individuals. The person who was appointed only reported to the president and was not accountable to any other institution. For example, in the Surkh Rod district of Nangarhar province (the Sultanpur area), a project to build a protective wall was implemented. I don't remember the exact cost, but it was very high. This project was approved thru the Ministry of Energy and Water at the time. The wall was supposed to be two and a half meters high below ground, hidden from public view, but it was only built to a height of about one and a half meters; another meter remained incomplete, and unsuitable materials were used. When the flood came, the wall collapsed and caused extensive damage to people's land. People complained, but because the head of the department and his close associates were involved at the top of the project, no one dared to follow up. The implementing company was also owned by the head of the department himself and was mostly selected based on ethnic ties. At that time, such disputes were unsolvable because when the project is the government itself and the government's power is behind it, the people have no way to resist. As a result, the problem remained unresolved and no authority had the jurisdiction to investigate.|At the National Water Resources Management Authority where I worked, foreign aid played a very effective role. No independent decisions were made; most projects were funded thru the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and the implementation of the projects depended on these resources. When the Ministry of Energy and Water was transformed into the National Water Regulatory Authority, a new problem arose: the authority was no longer accountable to parliament because its head was appointed by the president and only reported to him. There was no regulatory authority (except for the president himself). For this reason, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank stopped their aid. They said, \"We will not give money to an office that is not accountable and cannot be questioned.\" While the minister was approved by parliament and accountable to the people when the ministry existed. However, the administration lacked such legitimacy, which is why many of the projects that were in the plan were not implemented and remained unfinished.|Based on my experience with the reconstruction situation in Afghanistan, if the international community wants to intervene in post-war countries, it should provide aid thru non-governmental and international organizations (NGOs), not directly thru the government. Because when aid is channeled thru the government, there is usually nepotism, ethnic discrimination, and widespread corruption. The minister gives orders to his close associates, they pass them on to their employes, and the result is that the budget doesn't reach the real people. But in the international model: • A donor entity provides the funds, and a specific institution implements the project. • The second body independently (directly or indirectly) monitors whether the aid has reached the intended recipients. • Separate oversight reduces corruption and increases transparency. For this reason, if aid is provided thru international organizations and strong monitoring teams are in place, no one can act against global standards and people will benefit more from the results.\n",

And this incident caused the project to be delayed.|from 2014 to 2017, the Ministry of Public Health, under the leadership of Ferozuddin Feroz and with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), had a program to build rural clinics in the eastern part of the country. However, in Nangarhar province, administrative corruption at the level of the Public Health Directorate and local contractors led to contracts being awarded to affiliated companies and the work being carried out poorly. Many clinics remained unfinished, and the WHO temporarily suspended funding for the project. Administrative corruption hindered people's access to healthcare services and reduced the confidence of donors.|In 2018, the government initiated the Jaghori Dam project in Ghazni province without consulting the people of Andar district. People protested because they said the watercourse passed thru their land and their rights were being ignored. Because government officials did not cooperate with local elders and guilds, tensions escalated and the project was halted for several months. The lack of cooperation between the government and traditional structures caused delays in the project and led to public distrust.|From 2017 to 2020, several development projects in road construction and water supply were implemented in Daikundi province by USAID and UNOPS. Foreign donors themselves determined the routes, companies, and even the type of building materials, without sufficient coordination with the local administration or the people. Local officials suggested the road route pass thru more populated areas so more people could benefit, but because the final decision was made at the Kabul headquarters with the input of foreign consultants, the less beneficial route was chosen. The project was implemented at a high cost but with less benefit.|Afghanistan's experience shows that when decisions are made without consulting the people, transparency, and a national perspective, the outcome is usually failure; whether in ethnic decisions, government and administrative discussions, or projects implemented under foreign influence. Therefore, in any future international intervention, the aid framework should revolve around a few principles: first, national ownership – decisions should be made domestically, with the leadership of the government and local people, not in foreign offices, and not with the ethnic bias of past governments. Second, accountability and transparency – all projects must be implemented thru the national budget to enable monitoring and accountability. Third, public consultation – local councils and community elders should be involved in project design and monitoring from the outset to prevent ethnic and social conflicts. And in the financial resources section, there needs to be very close monitoring and auditing to prevent financial corruption.\n",
    "ID_S2_011|Policy Analyst/Policy Expert (in academic or research institutions)|About transnational leadership during the National Unity Government or the Republic from 2014-2020 is that the appointment of governors and heads of departments in Ghor was often based on ethnic affiliation and political pressure, not on merit. In several cases, individuals close to specific ethnic factions were appointed to head local departments such as Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Education, and Health. The result was increased ethnic competition between Tajiks, Hazaras, and Pashtuns within the administration, reduced coordination between institutions, many development projects remained unfinished, people lost trust in the administration, and social divisions widened.|Corruption as an obstacle to the coordination of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development's development projects, especially water supply and road construction projects in the province's districts. Contract companies were selected thru the mediation of some local officials, and a large portion of the project budget was embezzled. Some projects were never completed at all, or their quality was very low. As a result, donors like USAID and UNDP halted a portion of the funding, and project implementation was delayed for several years. Local people lost trust in government institutions.|The gap between the formal and traditional institutions of the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, which implemented an irrigation project without consulting local jirgas. Because the stream's path passed thru land belonging to another village and their consent had not been obtained, the conflict between the two villages escalated and the project was halted. Several months later, negotiations were resumed with the mediation of tribal elders, but government institutions had already lost their credibility.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic governance in adapting aid projects, particularly in the health and education sectors, which were funded by foreign entities such as USAID and the World Bank. Decision-making regarding priorities and budget was primarily done in Kabul and by foreign entities, without considering the actual needs of the people. Health centers were built in a few districts of the province, but permanent human resources and budget were not provided for them. The projects were seemingly completed but closed down after a few months. This dependence on external decisions made the local government feel powerless to manage independently.|Practical recommendations for the future based on my personal experiences. Aid should be managed and monitored thru local councils, namely Jirgas and Development Councils, not just from Kabul or foreign institutions. Local people should have a direct role in all stages, from planning to consumption. The reason is that in projects where the people of Ghor were involved in decision-making, such as some national solidarity and citizenship programs, there was less corruption and the work was actually completed. However, in projects where decisions were made in Kabul or by foreigners, more funds were wasted and there was no accountability.\n",

Mr. Fazli had studied nursing and did not have the understanding and knowledge of a large and important structure like the Presidential Affairs Department. Their selection was based on ethnicity and proximity to Ghani.|Aid and funding organizations for Afghan projects have always complained about corruption within the structures and were well aware of its widespread presence. The majority of Afghanistan's development projects were supported by the international community and implemented by state-owned companies, which were not executed properly due to wasted project budgets, leading to low project quality. For example, the Kabul-Kandahar road was built with low-quality materials and was very inefficient, deteriorating sooner than the standard they had set.|Ghani had a dual perspective. In its own ethnic structure, there was no problem with local councils. The Jirga somehow saw itself as the guarantor of power's firmness, but the ethnic, local organizations and ethnic Jirgas of other ethnic groups were seen as a threat to its power, and it said, \"We can no longer tolerate the 'island of power'.\" The reason for Ghani's conflict with other ethnic groups caused people not to support Ghani's government and further widened the gap between the government and the nation.

B) was influenced by ethnic bias and resulted in failure.

    "ID_S2_016|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|During the rule of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan under Presidents Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, senior officials served who prioritized national interests over ethnic, partisan, and religious interests. A prime example of this could be the extension of the security agreement between the Afghan government and NATO, which resulted in national security and national interests being guarantyd for a specific period. In contrast, a limited number of party leaders working within the government structure prioritized ethnic interests over national interests, and their ethnic policies widened divisions among the people, ultimately undermining national unity. Political parties active in Afghanistan were operating with an expanding ethnic agenda to attract supporters and win elections. Parties should not have considered ethnic, regional, linguistic, religious, or other factors that harm national interests and unity as criteria for their activities. As a result, division among the people increased and hopes for a bright future diminished. Afghanistan's credibility with the international community diminished and international aid was limited. Because most of these aids were misused by these individuals, and the path to Afghanistan's growth and development was challenged.|One sector that did not yield positive results due to widespread administrative corruption was Afghanistan's education sector. Due to the existence of ghost schools and teachers, most of the government's money and budget was embezzled by ministers and senior officials. Cases of administrative corruption in Afghan courts speak to the widespread corruption and lack of transparency. International aid, without effective accountability from ministry leaders, led to delays in the delivery of international assistance and a decline in the quality of education in the country.|International aid provided to Afghanistan should have been implemented in full coordination with the local people thru beneficial projects. Most areas of Afghanistan lack access to safe water, and projects implemented by international NGOs like DACAAR to improve access to safe water often faced implementation difficulties due to local conflicts. Every village or location wanted to implement these projects in their areas, but due to budget constraints, it was difficult for the aid received to reach all vulnerable areas. In many cases, local people prevented the implementation of foreign projects due to security concerns and the activities of armed opponents in their areas. In some cases, these issues were resolved in coordination with local CDC councils, and the local people provided specific conditions to allow these projects to be adapted. For example, the water supply project in Badakhshan and Kunar provinces, which were insecure and had limited access to the government, was implemented with the advice and coordination of local councils because these were humanitarian aid and did not pursue political goals, so the local people allowed the implementation. In conflict-ridden areas, there are widespread disputes over water sources, including the legal ownership of these water resources, which is contested by local people. This has caused project implementation to be delayed or halted.|On the one hand, foreign aid played a very important and vital role for the Afghan government and people in the post-civil war period. However, most of this aid was implemented without oversight and at the discretion of the donor countries, and the Afghan people were unaware of the amount of this aid and how it was spent. Civil activists have mostly expressed their concern that the lack of transparency in the use of domestic budgets and international aid undermines the effectiveness of these contributions. In some cases, donor countries often prioritized their national interests over foreign aid. For example, the aid provided by the Iranian government to the office of Hamid Karzai's government was due to American political and military competition, and they demanded their interests in return for this aid from the Afghan government. The aid that the Indian government continued to provide for the development of Afghanistan was aimed at weakening Pakistan's regional role in the Afghan issue. These factors, which exacerbated regional conflict and competition with neighboring countries, ultimately had a significant impact on national interests and security.|The main recommendation for improving international aid delivery by the global community is to provide transparent mechanisms for implementing these projects so that accountability for these projects is clear to the people. This aid should be under the direct supervision of the people, and the basic priorities of the people should be considered in the preparation of development plans. Afghanistan is in dire need of international aid. Afghanistan is not a poor country and is not in dire need of international aid. The government cannot handle this humanitarian crisis alone, and the international community must continue its assistance. Foreign aid provided by international aid organizations did not reduce poverty in the country due to a lack of transparency, and public distrust of this aid increased. Afghanistan is still an economically weak country, and according to international statistics, Afghanistan faces a harsh winter, making a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan still possible. In order for foreign institutional aid to be effectively implemented in the country, an effective accountability mechanism must be established in coordination with the government, civil society, and people's representatives so that this aid can be effectively implemented and Afghanistan can potentially achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n",

If we assume this statement is correct and disregard the existence of a concept called \"leader\" in Afghanistan, and consider an action that transcends one's nationality, we can cite the recognition of education by private institutions in the country as an effective measure. This decision was made and implemented by President Karzai and, in my opinion, is considered one of the lasting and historic actions for the country.| Very clearly and openly, Afghanistan is considered one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This incorrect historical pattern has a history dating back to the country's contemporary era, but it reached its peak during the decade of democracy. It's very difficult to provide an example of corruption! You might think that if there was so much widespread corruption, why would it be difficult to find such an example? The answer is that in all government projects, corruption was considered part of the job and was so institutionalized that no work could be considered exempt from corruption. Therefore, I mention the Ministry of Public Health's health project as an example. In the implementation of this important project, corruption was rampant and multi-faceted, which both delayed the project's completion and led to the ineffective use of international community aid.|One of the fundamental problems in Afghanistan is the conflict between tradition and modernity. This conflict manifests itself in various forms, sometimes as the government versus traditional society, and at other times in other forms such as modern education and schools, and so on. A large portion of unfinished projects and actions have been due to this conflict. If you look at the annual budget codes, you'll notice that a large portion of the allocated budgets hasn't been used. When you investigate the reason, you'll find that the local people have prevented the project from being implemented, saying it doesn't align with our traditions and customs. Specifically, I can mention the non-implementation of school construction projects in Khost and Logar provinces.|The Geneva meetings and the setting of 21 indicators by donors directly subordinated Afghanistan's policymaking and budget to foreign priorities. Instead of genuine reform, the government manipulated figures and engaged in a superficial fight against corruption to maintain the flow of aid. This process eliminated independent decision-making, institutionalized financial dependence, and sacrificed national interests for the sake of continued foreign aid.|Aid should be spent 100% thru the national budget and under local community oversight, rather than directly injecting currency and creating dependency, and the focus should be on strengthening domestic capacities.

For example, in the education sector in every province of Afghanistan, and similarly in every school at the provincial level, there were dozens and hundreds of fictitious teachers (there were no teachers at all). The name of the teacher was all that existed. Money and national budgets were embezzled by individuals at the leadership and management levels of the education sector.

These lands do not have official municipal documents, only customary ones. The government declared them public, and people began construction in this area. The municipality and land administration did not allow people to build here, but people started construction by paying money or using their connections with members of parliament or high-ranking officials of official institutions. However, this institution was unable or unwilling to solve the people's problems at their root, and now, with nearly a thousand homes built, they still lack municipal deeds and maps, and the government considers this land its own. Now the government is in trouble. If it demolishes all these houses, it will cost the government a lot of money, and the people will also be in a state of uncertainty and confusion. This indicates gaps in formal and legal institutions.|In Afghanistan, the president was appointed by the United States of America in consultation with the European Union.

However, the voter turnout was really low; the election site staff were just hoping someone would come and cast their vote.|If the international community wants to intervene in a post-conflict country, I have a few recommendations: 1) It must create strong, impartial infrastructure that is in line with the country's culture (such as transparent laws, the rule of law, impartial and accountable election monitoring bodies). 2) If other international organizations provide financial and humanitarian aid, instead of distributing it directly to the people, they should create employment opportunities, for example, by assisting and reviving sectors such as agriculture, handicrafts, and tourism, so that people can become self-sufficient and overcome their problems. 3) Establishing independent, impartial, and accountable media outlets for the people. 4) Establishing democratic institutions where the people themselves can choose their own destiny and their own leader. 5) Local people should have a role in how aid is distributed or consumed. 6) Instead of being consumptive, the focus on how aid is used should be developmental and infrastructural. 7) Instead of being distributed thru NGOs, aid should be created in the form of an agricultural bank or reconstruction. For example, it wants to provide low-interest loans to individuals in the agricultural sector or other businesses. If these individuals are successful, they will be given more loans or their interest will be waived so that people are encouraged to solve their own problems instead of always relying on aid.\n",
    "ID_S2_020|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|President Hamid Karzai's 2013 decision to jointly recruit young people from different ethnic groups to expand the national army is an example where national interests were prioritized over ethnic interests, resulting in a relatively positive outcome. Conversely, the decisions of some politicians during the 2019-2020 elections, which were based on ethnic biases, led to unsuccessful outcomes. a) National interests take precedence over ethnic interests - positive example • Background: From 2011 to 2014, the security situation in Afghanistan was poor and the withdrawal of international forces had been announced. It was necessary for the army and national police to be able to defend the entire country. • Action: Hamid Karzai announced a program to expand the national army, under which young people from different ethnic groups were recruited jointly. The recruitment process was intentionally designed to represent all of Afghanistan instead of a specific ethnic group. • Result: A relative balance was created in the camp's structure, which strengthened the sense of national identity and increased its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. Although problems remained, this decision reflected a transnational vision. b) Decision based on ethnic preferences – a failed example • Background: In the 2019-2020 elections, there was intense competition among political groups. Some high-ranking officials were making decisions to appease their ethnic supporters. • Action: Some politicians, whose support was based on ethnicity, opposed the election results and declared a parallel government. Instead of supporting transparent trends and national unity, decisions became subject to ethnic preferences. • Result: A legitimacy crisis was created, public trust in the government decreased, and the ground was prepared for the Taliban to regroup. This is a clear example of the negative consequences of a lack of national vision.|The Kabul Bank case – a clear example of corruption • Background: Kabul Bank was the largest private bank in Afghanistan and was used to pay salaries and finance development projects. International aid and government financial programs were primarily channeled thru this bank. • Action: Between 2010 and 2013, senior bank officials and individuals close to the government illegally withdrew approximately billion for personal gain. This corruption occurred thru fake loans, personal expenses, and funding political networks. • Result: Projects were halted: Educational and health projects whose salaries and budgets were paid thru Kabul Bank were delayed for several months. The quality of services decreased: Teachers and doctors were unable to continue working due to not receiving their salaries, and the quality of educational and health services declined. Cutting off foreign aid: International partners, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF), suspended aid programs to Afghanistan until the government takes serious action against corruption. By October 2012, only a small portion of the stolen money had been recovered, severely damaging global trust. Consonance obstacle (harmony) • This case showed that corruption is not just a domestic problem, but also erodes the trust of international partners. • The cessation and cutting of aid destroyed the atmosphere of cooperation between the government and the world and became a major obstacle to development projects. Result: The Kabul Bank scandal is a clear answer to this question: corruption causes project delays, reduces service quality, and cuts off foreign aid. This experience proves that the lack of transparency and accountability is the biggest obstacle to coordinating development programs.|The gap between formal and traditional institutions • Province: Helmand • Problem: Conflict over water resources (Helmand River water division) Explanation :In Helmand province, the water distribution problem worsened due to poor cooperation between government agencies and traditional local councils. • Background: The Helmand River's seawater is of vital importance for agriculture. There was no coordination between the government's official programs and the traditional decisions of the local elders. • Result: Water disputes increased, some areas faced water scarcity, and agricultural production decreased. The lack of joint decision-making between formal and traditional institutions hindered problem-solving. Positive control sample • Province: Nangarhar • Problem: Property dispute • Result: Due to effective cooperation between the state court and the local jirga, the land dispute was resolved jointly and both parties accepted the decision. Result: These examples show that when there is no cooperation (like in Helmand), conflicts are prolonged. But when cooperation is effective (like in Nangarhar), the problem is solved relatively successfully.|The impact of foreign aid on strategic autonomy . Example: The 2013-2015 security strategy, which was based on US and NATO assistance. Background • Due to the withdrawal of international forces (2014), the Afghan government was forced to design a large part of its security strategy and budget based on US and NATO aid. • The priority of global war contributors with the Taliban was to help and maintain major cities, not to create widespread local stability. Action • The focus of the national security strategy was placed on cities and highways, as requested by global partners. • Security funding was reduced for remote areas because donors controlled resource allocation according to their own priorities. Negative consequences • Contrary to national interests: The government's need was to secure the villages, but due to external pressure, security was only concentrated in the cities. • Result: The Taliban's influence in remote areas increased. The government's legitimacy decreased. Instead of long-term stability, a short-term defensive strategy was formed that was at odds with national interests. Result: This example shows that when national policy is subject to the priorities of foreign donors, the government's strategic independence is weakened, and the outcome is detrimental to national interests.|Practical advice for the future. Recommendation: Aid should be spent thru the \"national single budget,\" but under the transparent oversight of local people and with independent accountability mechanisms. How to make it practical • 1. National Unified Budget Framework: All global aid must be spent thru the official government budget, not thru separate donor projects. This prevents the creation of parallel offices and ensures coordination with national programs. • 2. Local Monitoring: At the provincial and district levels, people's councils or civil society organizations should monitor the implementation of projects. This reduces corruption and increases public trust. • 3. Independent Accounting: A common accounting system should be established for the use of aid, involving the government, global donors, and civil society. Reasons based on failures • During the reconstruction of Afghanistan, much of the aid was spent outside the government budget, resulting in: or creating parallel offices, or weakening the government's legitimacy, the increase in corruption, and the loss of public trust. Reasons based on successes • Projects implemented thru national budgets and under public supervision (such as some rural development projects) were relatively successful because people considered them \"their own projects.\" Result: To succeed in war-torn countries, aid must be channeled solely thru the national budget and be spent under public oversight and an independent accounting system. This framework prevents corruption, strengthens government legitimacy, and increases public trust.\n",

That's why we can't choose our own initiative and a correct perspective. For example, US aid and equipment for the training and education of the national army, which was entirely dependent on them, did not benefit the people much, and ultimately, the forces they deployed, Units 01 and 02, were deployed by them based on strategic decisions and plans that the government had not prepared or trained for, and ultimately, the US government took them with them. He took them with him, calling them his created and trained forces, not because they were being used effectively in Afghanistan's security affairs.|Afghanistan should have a thorough situation analysis based on impartial monitoring and surveys. Based on the analysis results and the situation, aid should be pledged to Afghanistan and transferred to Afghanistan thru Afghanistan's own national budget, and the use of this budget in Afghanistan should be monitored to prevent corruption in its expenditure. In other words, the institution or donor that is cooperating, or the international community itself, should closely monitor how its cooperation is being used. This is how monetary and financial corruption is prevented and a positive change is brought about in the work process.|\n",
    "ID_S2_022|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|A clear example of both states can be found during the Republic era (2011-2021). For example, we can recall Ashraf Ghani's decision to sign a security agreement with the United States, which he stated aimed to prioritize national interests over ethnic interests. Karzai refused to sign the treaty, but Hanif Atmar, the then foreign minister, signed the treaty on behalf of Ashraf Ghani in 2014. After the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in 2014, the debate over signing a \"Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA)\" with the United States was heated. Hamid Karzai refused to sign it, considering it contrary to national independence. However, at the beginning of the National Unity Government, despite political pressure from various ethnic factions, Ashraf Ghani decided to sign it. Ashraf Ghani stated that the purpose of this action was to ensure the survival of the government structure and security forces, maintain financial aid, and prevent a security vacuum. Many Pashtun-centric figures within the government and Karzai's circle opposed it by signing, but Ghani called it a \"national necessity.\" After signing this agreement, Western financial and military support for the Afghan government continued until 2021, and the Nano mission to assist and equip the national army continued. The signing of this treaty strengthened the international legitimacy of the Afghan government. Although this decision sparked criticism, it was a rare example of prioritizing national interests (in line with the survival of the republican system and the country's security) despite ethnic and political pressures, and it had positive short-term results. It is worth mentioning that Rahmatullah Nabil (former head of national security) also opposed political and ethnic pressures multiple times during his tenure as head of national security (2014-2016) and emphasized strengthening national and non-ethnic structures within the intelligence services. His opposition to the release of some Taliban figures, particularly due to political and ethnic pressures, was a sign of prioritizing national interests over ethnic interests. Nabil's resignation in protest against Ashraf Ghani's personal and discriminatory policies (during his visit to Pakistan) was a sign of his nationalist stance. b) Ethnically biased and exclusionary decisions (2017-2020). During Ashraf Ghani's second term as president, appointments in security institutions – particularly the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the National Directorate of Security – took on a distinctly ethnic flavor. Many commanders and governors were appointed based on the criterion of \"ethnic loyalty,\" regardless of their professional and technical competence. for example, in 2018, Ashraf Ghani appointed General Tariq Shah Bahrami (affiliated with a specific ethnic circle) as Minister of Defense instead of Abdullah Habibi. These changes, along with the gradual removal of Tajik and Uzbek commanders from security structures, sparked strong political reactions in the north of the country. This displacement weakened cohesion within the security forces and widened the gap between the northern forces and the central government. These decisions also undermined trust within the resistance fronts against the Taliban, ultimately leading to the rapid fall of provinces in 2021 as a result of the collapse of the chain of command and lack of coordination among the forces. This type of ethnocentric decision-making was an example of ethnic interests overriding national interests, which led to the weakening of the security structure and the collapse of the republican system. At the end of his second term, instead of strengthening national institutions, Hamid Karzai (President until 2014) strengthened a network of ethnic and local commanders to maintain his ethnic influence in the south of the country. In appointing governors and security officials, he prioritized ethnic balance over merit, and instead of strengthening \"nation-building,\" he pursued a policy of \"ethnic appeasement\" to ensure his political survival. These decisions of his had bad consequences and It rooted the culture of ethnic dealing in the government structure and passed it on to the next government. It then became clear that these Karzai programs were steps toward paving the way for the Taliban, until Ghani completed Karzai's unfinished mission by handing over the Arg to the Taliban. Amrullah Saleh (Ashraf Ghani's first deputy and former national security chief), despite his anti-terrorism and nationalist record, spoke from an ethnic perspective in the final years of his cooperation with Ghani, contributing to the polarization of the political atmosphere. Also, some of his statements and positions on social media, instead of emphasizing \"national convergence,\" sometimes took on an ethnic and linguistic tone. Such positions reduced the capacity for national unity within the anti-Taliban resistance front in the final days of the Republic.|No response|A clear example of this type of project can be explained in Nangarhar province, where the dispute was over water distribution in the Serekan (Spin Ghar) district. Between 2016 and 2019, the dispute between the farmers of two villages over the distribution of water from the \"Kameh\" irrigation canal intensified due to a lack of coordination between the Nangarhar Water Basin Department and local councils. Because the government had changed the canal route without consulting local influentials, local conflicts erupted and agricultural lands remained dry for several months. In contrast, a project in Bamyan province can be mentioned where the dispute over the boundary of agricultural lands in the village of \"Shiber\" (2018-2019) was resolved thru dialog. In this case, close cooperation between the Bamyan Department of Agriculture and local elders led to the establishment of a mediation committee, resolving the dispute peacefully thru dialog.|A specific example of this project was the decision-making process regarding the implementation of the \"TAPI\" project (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline) around the years 2015-2021, with the Asian Development Bank and the government of Turkmenistan as donors. Explanation: The Afghan government, under pressure and encouragement from foreign donors, especially the Asian Development Bank, prioritized the advancement of the TAPI project to be recognized as a regionally supported energy transit route. However, in practice, insecurity along the project route and the lack of guarantyd real benefits for the people of Afghanistan led to national investment in domestic energy infrastructure (such as electricity generation from northern gas or domestic dams) being overlooked. The failure of this project to materialize had negative consequences. This project never materialized, diverting government attention from more urgent domestic projects, increasing Afghanistan's political dependence on regional countries; as a result, Afghanistan's national interests were sacrificed to the geopolitical priorities of the donors.|Aid should be 100% channeled thru the government's national budget and monitored by the local people, not thru separate donor projects. Practical advice: In any post-war reconstruction program, before allocating funds and starting projects, a \"tripartite partnership structure\" must be established between the central government, local institutions, and civil society to ensure joint decision-making on priorities and monitoring of implementation. One successful example of this project was the Citizen Covenant program. In the \"Citizenship Covenant\" program (2016-2020), when village development councils participated in decision-making about small projects (such as roads or schools), the projects were implemented on time and with quality. However, in projects that were planned solely by ministries or foreign donors (such as some World Bank projects in the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development), work either stopped or the quality decreased due to local distrust and administrative corruption. This poor quality of projects will be resolved when they have genuine participation. This showed that without the genuine participation of the people and local leaders in design and monitoring, no foreign aid, even if it amounts to billions of dollars, will be sustainable or used effectively.\n",
    "ID_S2_023|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|Multinational countries and diverse societies need leaders who have a national and transnational vision to facilitate peaceful coexistence among all ethnic groups and various socio-political groups in light of the country/society's prevailing laws. My visit, along with that of former Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, with the perspective of prioritizing ethnic interests, paved the way in 2021 for the downfall of a legitimate, inclusive government in favor of a specific ethnic group (the Taliban), both of whom are from the same ethnic background (Pashtun). He removed experienced and influential individuals from the ranks of the security forces and civil positions, gradually handed over districts to the Taliban one after another, and finally brought an end to the 20-year Republic with his own escape.|Many international partners were involved in the corruption of high-ranking Afghan officials, and in many cases, they prevented their prosecution by judicial and legal institutions. In my opinion, the hypothesis that widespread corruption was the main obstacle to cooperation between the government and international partners is incorrect. On the contrary, high-ranking government officials and most of their international partners were complicit in widespread corruption, including the law, police, judiciary, prosecution, parliament, and the military. Everything was under the control of this corrupt gang; there was no second authority to hold them accountable, and everyone was in cahoots. I have personally seen dozens of infrastructure projects that, despite consuming huge sums of money, have not lasted due to poor quality and are currently unusable.|One of the main reasons for the lack of institutionalization of laws in Afghanistan's various systems has been these traditional tribal structures, and in many cases, despite the clarity of the law, disputes were resolved by local elders, which often resulted in injustice in the decisions of local councils and tribal elders' assemblies. Traditional and tribal structures have never been supportive of the rule of law in the country; on the contrary, these structures have weakened the law.|Exactly, governments dependent on foreign aid are not independent in their decision-making. For example: The extraction of the Aynak copper mine in Logar province was awarded by the then government to a Chinese company, but due to the disagreements and conflicts between China and Western countries, led by the United States, and because the Chinese company was also the financial backer of the then government, the extraction of this national project was not allowed to be realized, and the government was obliged to follow the policies and guidelines of the United States.|Not all countries are in the same state after a war; some may need to rebuild buildings, roads, bridges, and highways. However, some of these countries may have a serious need and priority for education, promoting the rule of law, strengthening national unity, raising citizens' knowledge levels, avoiding violence, and so on. Okay. In any case, international aid should be distributed and used thru the government institutions of the war-torn country with international supervision.\n",

However, with the intervention of a politician who sought to profit from the project, the project was never implemented.|Province: Balkh :Type of problem: Water resource conflict (agricultural irrigation)In 2019, a dispute arose in Chamtal district of Balkh province between the two villages of Chashma Shirin and Aq Kupruk over the distribution of water from the Balkhab River. The Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Directorate, without consulting the village council and local elders, decided to change the water distribution route in the secondary canal to help the new irrigation project. Local leaders and the local council considered this decision unilateral and contrary to the previous agreement, and prevented its implementation. The government was also unable to implement the decision without local support. Result : The channel remained closed for about two months. Agricultural lands in both villages were dry and damaged. Physical and armed clashes occurred between young people from two villages, and several people were injured. The issue was only temporarily resolved after a joint council was formed between the government and local elders.|It is clear that non-discretionary budgets (foreign aid) have a negative impact on the independent decision-making of government institutions. A specific answer will be provided below. Decision Topic: Increasing the size of security forces beyond the country's financial capacity Time: 2011-2014. Effective Donor: United States and NATO. Area: Security Policy and National Budget. Following the Chicago and Tokyo conferences, international donors, particularly the United States, emphasized the rapid increase in the number of Afghan security forces (army and police) to approximately 352,000 personnel. This decision was based more on NATO's military objectives than on an assessment of Afghanistan's economic and administrative capacity. Why was it against national interests? The Afghan government had warned that the national budget could not afford to pay the salaries, logistics, and maintenance of this number of troops, but accepted the proposal due to its dependence on foreign aid. Negative consequences: Creating strong financial dependence; over 90% of security expenditures were paid for by foreign aid. After aid was reduced in the years 1398-1400, livelihoods and equipping units faced difficulties. Inability to maintain expensive equipment and aircraft that could only be operated by foreign specialists. Decreased morale and the collapse of the command structure in the final months of the regime.|The intervention of the international community should be contingent on non-interference in political and economic decision-making. Foreign aid should be provided with full transparency and comprehensive oversight. Prevent rent-seeking. The information vacuum is filled and independent institutions are formed for oversight.\n",
    "ID_S2_025|Employee at an NGO or Relief Organization|: A) In short and concise terms, a decision by a senior Afghan government official that prioritized national interests over ethnic interests, and which had positive results, led the government to decide in the years 2011-2021 to implement the important infrastructure project of constructing a major highway that begins at the Kabul axis and ends in Bamyan and Daikundi, as well as along the Baghlan route, which connects the aforementioned provinces to the center of Kabul, based on national priorities. Despite political and ethnic pressures to divert funds to specific routes and regions, the project was implemented in accordance with public needs and national interests. The importance of this project was that it connected several central and northern provinces of Afghanistan with each other and with the capital. Result: - Transportation routes and the movement of merchants' goods between the aforementioned provinces were facilitated, and costs were reduced. - Public satisfaction increased, and people's trust in the government and the ruling system grew. - This project was one of the national projects in the decade (2010-2020) that was implemented regardless of ethnic affiliation. - The connection of the Herat, Badghis, Faryab, Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Ghazni routes, where people from the mentioned regions live with different ethnicities and languages, has connected their network, which demonstrates effective leadership free from ethnic interests. - Result: Positive, and its consequences: - Connecting important central, northern, and western provinces, reducing travel costs and facilitating travel for passengers, transporting goods, and increasing trade between provinces. - Widespread public satisfaction and increased trust between the people of the provinces and the center emerged. -Note: If you wish, you can also consider the road network and the connection of the Bamyan, Yakawlang-Kotel-e Qonaq-Nili (the center of Daikundi) and Jaghori routes as part of this large national network. B) Making a decision that was influenced by ethnic bias and had an unsuccessful and ineffective outcome: During the period 2011-2021, actions and measures were taken in the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health based on ethnic tendencies, network affiliation, and group affiliation, which: - In the Ministry of Education and Health, appointments and placements of individuals in key positions were made based on ethnic and group affiliation, while specialized and experienced staff were sidelined and individuals lacking experience and expertise were appointed to important and key positions. - In the years 2016-2018, official reports from Faryab, Paktia, Logar, and Takhar provinces showed that: - School construction and textbook printing projects were delayed due to poor management and corruption. - The books were not distributed on time. - Corruption in contracts increased. - Some donor-funded projects were canceled. - This is a clear example of decision-making failure influenced by bias.|Widespread corruption clearly had negative effects on international projects. There are specific examples of projects being delayed due to corruption. The National Rural Water Supply Program project in Uruzgan and Helmand provinces from 2014-2016, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development in collaboration with the World Bank, carried out rural water supply projects. According to information (reports) from Uruzgan and Helmand: - Local contractors embezzled part of the budget. - The drilling quality was unsatisfactory, and the water tank preparation was of poor quality. - The financial documents lacked transparency. Result: The World Bank halted the project for several months, and thousands of families were left without access to clean water. Reduced service quality: Health programs in the Ministry of Public Health, in 2017, in the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, and Farah, reported that health implementing companies had illegally withdrawn a portion of the budget, which resulted in: - Clinics were left without medicine or medical supplies. - Employe salaries haven't been paid for months. - Maternal and child mortality increased, and the quality of health service delivery severely declined and even collapsed. - Cutting off foreign aid due to corruption: The printing and publication of textbooks in the Ministry of Education in 1397 (solar year) was supported by international donors, especially the European Union. After the exposure of corruption in the printing and publication contracts for hundreds of thousands of textbooks for education students, the following decisions were made: - They completely cut off the budget that had been allocated. - The project's execution was halted pending complete reviews. - Millions of students were unable to receive books in the next academic year. - The Ministry of Education's credibility was questioned and the level of trust in it decreased significantly.|The effects of the gap between formal and traditional institutions. There are clear examples where projects have faced difficulties in implementation due to poor cooperation between formal and traditional institutions. In Baghlan Province - Burka District: Problems and conflicts over the distribution of irrigation canal water in 2015. Without coordinating or consulting with local elders, the government implemented a new water distribution plan. This action resulted in: - Two villages entered into conflict and dispute. - Several acres of land were destroyed. - The canal improvement project was halted for several months. Matters that have been resolved correctly and effectively due to effective cooperation between formal and traditional institutions: In Herat Province, Injil District: Problems and disputes arose between the two families (tribes) regarding irrigated lands. To resolve this issue, the government, in collaboration with the local council, the tribal jirga, the land authorities, held joint meetings and sessions, which resulted in: - The conflict was resolved non-violently. - The land was officially registered by the government. - The irrigation project that was beyond was implemented without any problems.|How foreign aid affects the government's independent decision-making. A) Supportive effects on government decision-making: In the years 2011-2016, the United States and NATO insisted and emphasized the implementation of development budgets in the security sector. Donors insisted that more budget be spent on creating security forces, building bases, and equipping the police. The government was forced to: - Transfer a large portion of development budget from economic and infrastructure projects to security-focused (security) projects. B) Negative consequences and repercussions (contrary to national interests) that resulted in the following: - Economic projects (road construction, energy, agriculture) were underfunded and poorly developed. - The level of economic growth decreased and slowed down. - The country's dependence on foreign aid increased. - It created public dissatisfaction with the lack of development services.|Practical recommendations for the future (Framework for assistance) Based on the lessons learned over the years and real-world experience in Afghan society, how should it be and what should be done? Based on past experiences, it is suggested that international aid to Afghanistan (a post-conflict country) be implemented in a hybrid model. How? - 50% of the aid will be implemented and operationalized thru the national government budget, under the supervision of an independent body, civil society councils, and the media. - 50% of the aid will be implemented thru independent donor projects to reduce the risks of politicization and corruption. Perhaps we can find an example of this model in the Citizen Contract Program (CCNPP), where local community monitoring led to greater transparency and trust. It is also worth noting that at the same time and during that era, the helpers maintained their technical roles, which had a positive outcome.\"\"\"\n",
